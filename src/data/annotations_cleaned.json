D031220 NEW WESTMINSTER REGISTRY IN THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA BETWEEN: ) ) PATRICIA ELSIE DeCENZO ) REASONS FOR ) PETITIONER ) JUDGMENT OF ) AND: ) MASTER JOYCE ) FRANK RAY DeCENZO ) (IN CHAMBERS) ) RESPONDENT ) W. Stilling, Q.C. Appearing on behalf of the petitioner S.R. Hogan, Esq. Appearing on behalf of the respondent Place and date of hearing: New Westminster, British Columbia November 3, 1993 NATURE OF THE APPLICATION The petitioner seeks an order pursuant to s.15 of the Divorce Act, 1985 that \"the child support payable by the petitioner to the respondent pursuant to a Separation Agreement dated March 29, 1982 be cancelled, terminated, rescinded or varied and that maintenance arrears thereunder be fixed in the sum of $3,866.64 to be paid to the respondent at the time of the settlement of the family home between the petitioner and the respondent\". FACTS The parties married on January 25, 1971 and separated September 21, 1981. The parties had three children: Kimberley Florence, born April 26, 1971, Marcia Christina Lenora, born December 26, 1975, and Jennifer Patricia, born September 13, 1978. The children remained in the care of the respondent following the separation of the parties. On March 29, 1982 the parties entered into a Separation Agreement. The portions of that agreement which are relevant to this application are set out below: 6. The Husband shall have sole custody, care and control of the infant children, KIMBERLEY FLORENCE DeCENZO, MARCIA CHRISTINA LENORA DeCENZO, and JENNIFER PATRICIA DeCENZO, and the Wife shall be entitled to reasonable and generous access. 7. Upon obtaining regular full-time employment, the Wife will pay to the Husband the sum of Sixty-Six Dollars and Sixty-Seven ($66.67) Cents per month for the support and maintenance of each of the infant children, being altogether the sum of Two Hundred ($200.00) Dollars per month, such payment to continue with respect to each child so long as such child resides with the Husband until such child attains the age of Nineteen (19) years, becomes self-supporting or dies, whichever event shall first occur. . . 9. During the continuance of this Agreement and while not in default hereunder, the Husband shall be entitled to the sole right of possession of the former matrimonial home located at 2448 - 240th Street Langley, British Columbia; ALWAYS PROVIDED THAT in lieu of rent, the Husband shall satisfy from time to time all obligations arising out of the Mortgage until the same is fully paid and satisfied. 10. The Husband shall satisfy all property taxes, utilities charges, regular maintenance and repairs required to keep and maintain the said property without any expense to the Wife, and the Husband agrees to indemnify and save harmless the Wife from any liabilities howsoever arising therefrom. 11. When the youngest then-surviving child of the marriage ceased to be a full-time student, graduates from high school, or moves from the said property, whichever event shall first occur, the Husband and Wife agree that the said property shall be forthwith sold, with the net proceeds of sale after payment of any amounts owing pursuant to the Mortgage being split equally between the Husband and the Wife. The Separation Agreement was not registered with this court in accordance with s.74 of the Family Relations Act . The only maintenance paid by the petitioner was $200 in each of April and May of 1982, $150 in August 1982 and $100 in October 1982. She deposes that she made those payments notwithstanding that she was not employed full-time. She deposes that she ceased making any maintenance payments because the respondent was poisoning the children against her and made it clear that he wished her to have nothing to do with the children. The petitioner deposes that she worked part-time only until July 1989. In her affidavit she set out her earnings during the period 1982 to July 1989 based upon a review of her pay slips. The petitioner admits that she was employed full-time from July 1989 until July 1991 when she quit her job. She deposes that her supervisor was an alcoholic who drank at work and that the employment conditions were intolerable. There is no dispute that the petitioner did not pay maintenance during the time she was employed full-time and admits that there are arrears for that period totalling $3,866.64. The petitioner deposes that she worked for Shelter Industries from July to October 1991 then received unemployment insurance benefits until July 1982 when she found employment at a golf course where she worked until October 1992. The petitioner became pregnant in August 1992 and gave birth to her child on May 26, 1993. It appears that she has not worked since October 1992. The petitioner wishes to stay at home to care for her child. She is supported by her common law spouse, the father of the child. The petitioner commenced these proceedings on April 5, 1993. In her petition she refers to and relies upon the Separation Agreement. In his Counter-Petition the respondent seeks, amongst other relief, interim and permanent child support pursuant to s. 15 of the Divorce Act, 1985 or s.56 of the Family Relations Act . He also seeks a determination of arrears under the Separation Agreement and a set-off of those arrears against the petitioner's interest in the former matrimonial home. He seeks a judicial reapportionment of assets or, alternatively, variation of the Separation Agreement pursuant to s.54 of the Family Relations Act . The respondent has agreed to suspend maintenance payable by the agreement for a period of six months following the birth of the child, that is until December 1, 1993. ISSUES 1. Does s.15 of the Divorce Act, 1985 enable the petitioner to seek this order? 2. What is the effect of the Separation Agreement? 3. Is the court entitled to deal with arrears of maintenance which have accrued under the agreement on an application under s. 15? 4. If so, what is the amount of the arrears? 5. Is the petitioner entitled to suspension of enforcement of arrears pending a sale of the former matrimonial home? 6. Is the petitioner entitled to have the maintenance obligation set out in the agreement cancelled or varied? 7. Is the petitioner entitled to a suspension of enforcement with respect to her maintenance obligations pending sale of the former matrimonial home? ANALYSIS 1. Does s.15 of the Divorce Act, 1985 enable the petitioner to seek this order? Section 15(2) of the Divorce Act, 1985 provides that the court may, on application of either or both spouses, make an order requiring one spouse to pay or secure and pay periodic or lumps sum support for the other spouse or for the children of the marriage. Subsection (3) permits the making of an interim order. In this case the petitioner does not apply for an order requiring her to pay. On the contrary, she seeks, in effect, an order absolving her of any requirement to pay interim support. The order sought is in the nature of a declaration of her obligation. I am of the opinion that the petitioner can seek an order under s.15 which determines her obligation to pay interim support pursuant to the Divorce Act, 1985 . However, for the reasons given in the following sections, I am of the opinion that the petitioner cannot obtain a variation of the Separation Agreement, as such, pursuant to s.15. 2. What is the effect of the Separation Agreement? 3. Is the court entitled to deal with arrears of maintenance which have accrued under the agreement on an application under s. 15? It is convenient to deal with these two issues together. The maintenance provision in the Separation Agreement is, in my view, a matter of contract between the two parties. It is not subject to a variation application under s.17 of the Divorce Act, 1985 . The agreement was not filed with the court pursuant to the provisions of s.74 of the Family Relations Act and is not enforceable under that section as though it were an order of the court made under that act. Therefore, it would not be subject to variation under s.62 of the Family Relations Act , even if that section was relied upon. The property provisions of the agreement may be subject to judicial alteration under s.51 or s.54 of the Family Relations Act but those sections do not appear to give the jurisdiction to vary maintenance provisions. In any event any application under those sections should be determined at trial. I conclude, therefore, that there is no basis upon which the court can retroactively \"cancel, rescind or vary\" the maintenance provisions of the agreement on this interim application. Likewise there was no authority provided which would permit the court to suspend whatever rights the respondent may have to enforce the maintenance provision or to take proceedings based upon the petitioner's alleged default under the agreement pending sale of the former matrimonial home. While there is no ability retroactively to vary maintenance, the court is not precluded from making an order under s. 15 of the Divorce Act, 1985 determining the amount of interim child support, if any, which ought to be paid notwithstanding the existence of an agreement respecting maintenance. The existence of an agreement is not a bar to the Court's jurisdiction to make whatever order for child support may be appropriate. The existence of an agreement is certainly a factor for the court to consider in determining interim support and may afford strong evidence that the agreement made adequate provision for the needs of the children but it is not determinative of the issue. [See e.g. Dickson v. Dickson (1987) 11 R.F.L. 337 (B.C.C.A.) ]. 4. If so, what is the amount of the arrears? 5. Is the petitioner entitled to suspension of enforcement of arrears pending a sale of the former matrimonial home? For the reasons stated above it is not appropriate to deal with these issues on this application. 6. Is the petitioner entitled to have the maintenance obligation set out in the agreement cancelled or varied? More accurately stated, the issue is what is the appropriate amount, if any, which the petitioner should pay by way of interim child support, taking into account the factors and objectives set out in s.15, including the existence of the Separation Agreement. The agreement was entered into with full disclosure and after receiving legal advice. The situation in which the petitioner now finds herself was not one which could be said to be unexpected or unanticipated. In my view the agreement is a very important consideration in this case. Counsel for the petitioner submits, in essence that the petitioner lacks the means to provide monetary support and that the petitioner's obligation to support her children is met to a sufficient degree by her agreement to delay a sale of the former matrimonial home and to permit the respondent and children to reside in the home without any obligation on the part of the respondent to pay occupation rent. That forbearance on the part of the petitioner is a benefit to the respondent and children. However, it is not without consideration on the part of the respondent. He has agreed to pay the mortgage and to maintain the property for the benefit of the petitioner as well as for himself. Subject to any judicial reapportionment under ss.51 or 54 the petitioner stands to receive a one half interest in property which has appreciated substantially in value. Furthermore, the quantum of child support set out in the agreement is extremely modest, in part, I conclude, because of the petitioner's agreement to a delay on sale. The petitioner wishes to remain at home with her infant rather than place the child in daycare so that she can work. That is an understandable desire. But the petitioner has obligations towards her other children which ought not to be sacrificed for the benefit of the new child. The petitioner has taken on her new responsibilities knowing of her existing obligations. A similar issue arose in the recent case of Zerr v. Zerr (1993) 48 R.F.L. (3d) 31 (B.C.S.C.) . There the father was obliged by order to pay maintenance for his two children in the amount of $175 per child. The mother, who had custody, was employed. Subsequently the mother entered into a new relationship and had a child. She wished to remain at home with the young child and sought an increase in child support. Clancy, J. referred to Savoie v. Lamarche (1990) 71 D.L.R. (4th) 481 (Que.C.A.) in which the circumstances were similar to those in the present case. The non-custodial mother had a child from a new relationship and sought to have her support obligations eliminated. At p.488 Chevalier J. said: \"In my view it is also unacceptable to suppose, as the appellant has done in this case, that in principle the birth of a child automatically gives a parent the right to be exempted from the obligation of financial support, by unilaterally deciding to cut herself off from any source of income by which she could provide for them. Whatever the intrinsic merits of the reasons for her actions, the appellant must realize that she still has obligations to her other two children and that she can only fulfil those obligations by returning to the workforce.\" Clancy, J. expressed his agreement that a person is not entiled to give up employment entirely and expect a former spouse to bear the full burden of that decision. He did conclude, however that for a period of time following the birth of a child a working mother has a diminished ability to contribute to maintenance but that after a reasonable period of time she should be expected to return to the workplace. That, it seems to me, is just what the respondent has suggested in this case by agreeing to suspend maintenance for a period of six months. It is suggested that the agreement obliges the petitioner to pay child maintenance only during those periods when she has regular full-time employment. In my opinion that is a strained interpretation. It seems to me that the intent of the parties was to give the petitioner an opportunity to establish herself in the workforce and that once she was so established the obligation would arise and would thereafter remain. Even if the agreement were read as suspending maintenance during periods of involuntary unemployment, and I have considerable doubt that that is a correct interpretation, the evidence fails to establish that the petitioner is not able to be employed. I therefore decline to make the order sought under s.15. There was no cross application by the respondent for interim support under either the Divorce Act, 1985 or the Family Relations Act . Accordingly, the Separation Agreement will continue to determine the parties continuing rights and obligations in respect of child maintenance. 7. Is the petitioner entitled to a suspension of enforcement proceedings pending sale of the home with the accrued maintenance to be paid from the sale proceeds? It is my view that the court has no ability on this application to deal with suspension of enforcement with respect to obligations under the Separation Agreement. ORDER The application is dismissed. \"B. M. Joyce\" Master B.M. Joyce January 5, 1994 New Westminster, British Columbia",

        "text": "Date of Release: January 12, 1995 No. A900518 Vancouver Registry IN THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA BETWEEN: ) ) KAREN ELAINE CHURCH ) REASONS FOR JUDGMENT ) PLAINTIFF ) OF THE HONOURABLE ) AND: ) MR. JUSTICE WARREN ) STEWART EDWARD HAGEN ) (IN CHAMBERS) ) DEFENDANT ) Dates and place of hearing: January 4 and 6, 1995 Vancouver, British Columbia Counsel for the plaintiff/respondent: K.O. LaBelle Counsel for the defendant/applicant: B. McNeill 1 The defendant applies pursuant to s. 62 of the Family Relations Act for an order varying the amount of child support payable for the child of the marriage, Ryan, who is in the custody of the plaintiff. The order sought to be varied is that of Mr. Justice Mazko of June 18, 1992. The defendant says that there have been significant changes in his circumstances since the making of that order; namely, he now has custody of the two children of his first marriage, his business which was not thriving has been sold to his present wife whom he married in July 1993, and most significantly, he suffered a heart attack in December 1993 and has not been able to work since. By my rough reckoning this is the third or fourth application made by the defendant to vary; it certainly is not the fourth or fifth time the parties have been in court over the subject of support. There have been a number of appearances to enforce the payment of support in Provincial court. 2 The history of the orders can be briefly summarized. May 11, 1990 by consent, the parties agreed to the sum of $500 a month for the interim support of Ryan. Thereafter the parties entered into minutes of settlement which provided for the payment of that sum until further agreement or court order with the terms of the minutes of settlement to be incorporated into an order of the Supreme Court \"as a term of the divorce order in any petition for divorce proceedings commenced by the plaintiff or the defendant\". When the action under the Family Relations Act was heard in 1992, the only issue was the amount of child support, at least as I read the oral reasons for judgment of Mazko, J. It appears the defendant applied to reduce the amount of support based in part upon a medical condition [cancer] and the decline in the profitability of his business. Mazko, J. was clearly of the view that the amount of support was appropriate. He was equally satisfied that the defendant had not discharged the burden upon him to satisfy the court that there had been a significant change in his circumstances since the making of the 1990 order. The defendant brought on another application to vary in July 1993 and filed materials in support. That application did not proceed due to the heart attack the defendant suffered in December 1993. That application seems to have simply been adjourned generally or abandoned. There is no indication that the term of the Minutes of Settlement requiring that the support provision be incorporated into a divorce judgment was complied with; certainly it appears the parties were divorced as the defendant remarried in July 1993 following a brief period of a \"common law\" relationship with Sharnell Muir beginning in January 1993. Ms. Muir was and is a dentist. At the time their relationship began, she had a practice in Langley which she sold in February 1993 when the defendant and she decided to relocate to the Okanagan where the majority of the defendant's business was. The new wife of the defendant was not able to obtain any work other than for two weeks as a locum in October of 1993. In February she opened her own practice. Her 1993 net income appears to have been $114,000 for that is the amount shown on the defendant's 1993 T-1 tax return. His employment income for the same period was $6750 due, he says, to a slump in his business. He deposes that he was obliged to borrow sums of money from Ms. Muir, such that in the summer of 1994 he signed a demand promissory note dated August 15 in the amount of $55,272.10 in favour of Ms. Muir. The particulars of the money borrowed are set out in the note which acknowledges a loan or loans from her during the period February 1993 to July 1994 of approximately $22,440. These loans he says, were necessary in order for him to meet his living expenses. The plaintiff points to the fact that with the sale of the defendant's home in Maple Ridge in September 1992, he had a credit balance of $25,650 remaining after making a deposit of $40,000 for the new home and paying off substantial debts owing to his former wives. There was and is no explanation of the use of this sum of money yet the defendant deposes that he was obliged to start borrowing from his new wife some four or five months later in February 1993. By the time he swore his affidavit on November 15, 1993, the defendant deposed that he was indebted to his wife, Ms. Muir, in the sum of $6,940. By August 15, 1994, nine months later, the debt had increased by roughly $15,000. There was no underlying documentation to support or explain this. The total debt was, in part, the consideration for the transfer of the defendant's interest in the Mara property to his wife, Ms. Muir. 3 In any event the defendant deposes to the fact that with the settlement he and the plaintiff arrived at in August 1994, he satisfied a portion of the debt owing to Ms. Muir by transferring to her his interest in their home. There now remains owing on that debt the sum of $7500. 4 The material discloses that the defendant attempted to sell his business in 1992 without success. He had bought out the plaintiff's interest with the settlement in 1990 and he was the sole shareholder. Finally, in February 1993, he sold his interest in the business to Ms. Muir for $8,000 and entered into an employment contract with the company. The terms of his remuneration set out in the contract, require the company to pay him a percentage of the profits of the company. I am not clear whether the remuneration is as set out in the typewritten portion or that which has been handwritten into the contract; the amendment has been initialled by the defendant but not by Ms. Muir. In the event it is the amended figure, it requires the company to pay him 10% of the net profit of the company after tax but before management bonus, payable within six months of the company's year end which is the last day of February. The last financial statements are for the period ending February 28, 1993 almost two years ago, and thus there is no current information from the defendant's employer whether there are any profits, nor for that matter, whether the company has had any revenues. In brief, I do not know what precisely are the financial affairs of the company. I am aware that the affidavits of Mr. Hagen depose that he is not capable of working for the company and that a licensed operator is required by a pesticide operator, but the material falls short of satisfying me that the defendant is incapable of performing any work, either for the company or otherwise, or that some efforts have been made to continue with the operations of the company using hired help supervised or directed by the defendant. The plaintiff is entitled to be suspicious that, with the professional practice of the defendant's wife, he may be content to be more leisurely in the pursuit of employment. 5 Nor am I satisfied that there has been the kind of complete and reliable disclosure needed to justify the making of the order sought. Some examples will be sufficient to demonstrate my concern. 6 The defendant swore two Property and Financial Statements detailing his circumstances as of the month of October 1994. The first was for the use of this court on the hearing of this application. The other was for the use in Vernon in the defendant's application for an order that his first wife pay child support for their two children presently living with him. The two statements were sworn twenty days apart. The first deposes to total monthly expenses of $3,400 while the second deposes to total monthly expenses of $4,370. The first does not disclose any income whatsoever while the second shows his present wife's income at $3,400. There is a $1,000 difference between the two in the value shown for general household items. The first shows debts and liabilities of $20,180 while the second shows the debts at $12,242. Finally, the statement in support of this application discloses the disposition of the primary residence in Maple Ridge and the transfer of his half interest in the Mara property, while the second statement discloses only the disposition of his company. Each inconsistency is significant. At the very least it erodes the confidence which I ought to have when considering the evidence of the applicant. 7 Next, when the defendant made application in the fall of 1993, he deposed in his affidavit sworn in July 1993 (filed October 26, 1993) that he was currently living with his common law spouse, a \"dentist and ... currently not practising [sic]\". The affidavit sworn October 1, 1994 deposes that his wife sold her Langley practice in February 1993 and she did not work as a dentist from January 1993 until October 1993 as no work was available for her other than a brief locum for two weeks in October 1993, and that she opened her own practice in February 1994. The clear implication to be drawn from either affidavit is that there was a significant financial burden being born by the defendant and his new wife. However, when the defendant made his application in Vernon earlier referred to, he attached his last three income tax returns. Page 3 of the 1993 return showed his wife's net income as $114,280. This return was not originally filed on this application by the defendant. Rather, it was an exhibit to the affidavit filed on behalf of the plaintiff. Only after that did the defendant attach a copy as an exhibit to his affidavit in reply, filed December 8, 1994. In explanation he deposed that he had thought it had been filed by his previous solicitor. 8 Lastly, the material in support of the averment that he is medically incapable of working, falls short of what is required in a case contested as vigorously as this one is. The first memorandum of his condition is contained in a prescription slip written by his general practitioner. The second and only slightly longer \"report\" was attached as an exhibit to his November 22, 1994 affidavit. It reports of intermittent episodes of angina, particularly on stress or exertion and of a test done in July 1994. The diagnosis is of a triple vessel disease but no critical stenosis of any of the vessels. His doctor felt he was still at risk and that she did not feel \"it was wise for him to return to work until such time as he has been symptom free for several months \" [my underlining]. I know that this matter was to proceed several times before it was finally referred to me last week, but several months have passed since the letter, and in any event, it is not as informative as it should be. Counsel for the plaintiff notes that it does not comply with the requirements of the Evidence Act , it makes no reference to other procedures and examinations conducted and it does not state when the last symptom was experienced. 9 The position of the plaintiff may briefly be summarized as follows: the defendant has not made out a case demonstrating a significant change in circumstances and the material filed in support of the application raises more questions than it answers. The plaintiff says that the financial information of the defendant's wife is relevant and the case law requires that the non- custodial parent seeking a subsistence reduction must be prepared to suffer a reduction in his/her standard of living before that of the child. The plaintiff relies upon Levesque v. Levesque ; Birmingham v. Birmingham , [1994] 8 W.W.R. 589 , Alberta Court of Appeal. The defendant replies that Levesque is essentially dicta insofar as the reference to income of cohabitants, and that this court is bound to follow R. v. R. , Vancouver Registry No. A892673 , Spencer, J. March 21, 1994 on the basis of judicial comity [Re Hansard Spruce Mills, Ltd. [1954] 4 D.L.R. 590] . 10 In R. v. R. , Spencer J. stated: The second wife is, of course, not required to support the children of the first marriage, but her presence may be considered to the extent that she assists, or should assist, the father by contributing to their shared costs of living. 11 I do not find that statement to be at odds with the statements of the Alberta Court of Appeal in Levesque . I agree with that court when it holds that poverty, if there is to be poverty, must be shared, but the parents must pick up most of the slack. At p. 605 the court observed: It follows that any subsistence adjustment would not drive the award paid so low that the subsistence level of the other parent, or the child, falls below that of the parent seeking the adjustment. 12 On the facts of this application as I perceive them, I am not satisfied that were I to accede to the defendant's application, that would not be the result. The Alberta Court of Appeal reiterates well settled law that a person seeking to vary an award must make the fullest disclosure and demonstrate that there is no unavoidable expense [see also Longstaffe v. Longstaffe , (1994) 86 B.C.L.R.(2d) 1 ]. The court also urges other judges to review other relevant factors, including: (ii) The judge should examine other sources of assistance in fact available to the party asking for an adjustment, including not only social services and new spouses , but also the extended family of each parent and the child. It is at this point that the income of cohabitants becomes relevant. (iii) The general principle is that maintenance is payable before debts.... (iv) The judge should keep in mind that any reduction in the living standard of the custodial parent can lead to a reduction in the living standard of the child.... 13 All of these factors have a play in the application before me. The defendant has remarried and his wife is a professional with a practice of her own. I have no knowledge of her circumstances other than the bald statement that her income is $3,400. A court is entitled to have disclosure of a second spouses fortune estate and prospects when being asked to vary a support order. There are a number of benefits available to a sole practitioner which are not taxable but go a long way to improving the day to day standard of living. These details should, in my view, be available to the chambers judge. Further, I am satisfied that at this moment in time, with the plaintiff concluding her retraining and being dependant upon her rental income, savings and loans from her parents for tuition and living expenses, as well as the support payable by the defendant, any reduction in the child support would lead to a reduction in the standard of living of the child. I am not satisfied on this material that such a reduction in the standard is warranted, particularly where, as part of a settlement of the arrears last summer, the defendant paid a lump sum of money to the plaintiff sufficient to pay the child support until June of 1995. In that sense the application is somewhat premature. In any event, the lack of adequate medical evidence of the defendant's condition, together with insufficient particulars of his spouse's financial circumstances, including the financial statements of the company, warrant that this application be dismissed. Should there be more complete evidence then, of course, the defendant is at liberty to reapply in the summer of 1995. 14 The plaintiff is entitled to her costs of this application. \"Warren, J.\" January 12, 1995 Vancouver, British Columbia",

Suburban Motors Date: 20000113 2000 BCCA 46 Docket: V03348 Registry: Victoria COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA ORAL REASONS FOR JUDGMENT Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice Finch January 13, 2000 The Honourable Mr. Justice Donald The Honourable Madam Justice Newbury Victoria, B.C. BETWEEN: CURTIS CHRISTIE PLAINTIFF (APPELLANT) AND: SUBURBAN MOTORS LTD. DEFENDANT (RESPONDENT) Douglas H. Christie appearing for the Appellant Robert T.C. Johnston, Q.C. appearing for the Respondent [1] DONALD, J.A.: The plaintiff, Curtis Christie, appeals from the dismissal of his action for breach of contract. [2] The contract was one of employment. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant failed to train him properly as an autobody repairman during a four year apprenticeship and that when the defendant offered him a non-journeyman position at the end of his term he was constructively dismissed. [3] The trial was heard by Mr. Justice Melvin who, in his reasons given on 16 September 1998, held that the plaintiff did not prove that the defendant had failed to fulfill its obligations under the apprenticeship agreement nor did the plaintiff prove any loss. [4] The judge observed that it was \"tragic\" that the plaintiff refused an offer to extend the apprenticeship period for an additional year at the fourth year rate of pay (90% of the journeyman rate). In so refusing the offer the judge said that the plaintiff \"authored his own misfortune\". [5] On appeal the plaintiff alleges that the trial judge erred in failing to address the specific claims and by ignoring important evidence. [6] For reasons which follow I have not been persuaded that the decision should be disturbed. [7] The plaintiff began work with the defendant on 17 June 1991 washing cars, sweeping up and performing similar tasks. On 22 January 1992 the parties entered into an apprenticeship agreement for a four year term to train the plaintiff in the autobody repair trade. [8] The agreement obliged the defendant to teach the plaintiff the trade efficiently and to provide him with adequate training in all practices of autobody repair insofar as the facilities and scope of the defendant's business would permit. The defendant was also required to notify the Director of Apprenticeship of any difficulties that might interfere with the carrying out of the terms of the agreement. The plaintiff was required to attend classes and to attend at the defendant's place of business and perform his duties faithfully, diligently and honestly. At the end of the agreement, the defendant was under no obligation to certify or hire the plaintiff. [9] During the first year of the contract, apparently as a result of conversations with other apprentices about their experiences, the plaintiff became concerned with the quality of instruction he was receiving. He made no mention of this either to the defendant or to the Director. [10] At the end of the second year the defendant thought that the plaintiff was not performing at expected levels but there is no indication that the Branch was informed of that. A notation on the records kept by the Apprentice Branch for 17 March 1995, which was in the fourth year, reads as follows: The plaintiff's apprenticeship was to expire in 10 months time. [11] On 4 August 1995 the plaintiff learned that the defendant had concerns about his abilities and questioned whether he would obtain certification. The plaintiff immediately went to the Apprenticeship Board and notified them that the defendant was not going to certify him but had offered him a job at $12 per hour instead of the more than $20 an hour a journeyman would earn. [12] The Board then became involved in discussions with both parties. As a result of those discussions it was decided that a concerted effort would be made to provide him with sufficient work to attain his accreditation. A further set of notations in the Apprenticeship office records for October 12 and 19, 1995, indicate that the parties were satisfied with the tasks that the plaintiff was given. [13] However, by November the plaintiff became convinced that he was not at a sufficient level to obtain certification and he told the employer he wanted to leave and continue his apprenticeship at some other place. [14] On the evidence there was a difference in opinion between the parties as to the level the plaintiff had reached at this point. The plaintiff felt that he was still at the first year level. The defendant's view was that he was at the third year level but that it had not yet determined whether they would be able to certify him in December. The defendant offered to extend the apprenticeship term for an additional year on the terms that I have indicated but the plaintiff persisted in his belief that he would not get satisfactory training with the defendant. The parties then worked out his entitlement to back pay and severance under the Employment Standards Act and the plaintiff was duly paid off. [15] The judge held that this constituted a settlement of the dispute. I am unable to accept that view of the matter. The pay-out was simply a consequence of the separation and not a negotiated resolution of the claim that the defendant failed to fulfill its obligations under the apprenticeship agreement. Nevertheless the judgment can be supported on other grounds. [16] The judge's reasons were ex tempore and as such did not touch on every point of evidence nor did they analyze the case by reference to the legal concepts involved. This is not a criticism, it is often better for the parties to get a speedy determination of the case; but it is not expected that oral reasons will be as thorough or as finely crafted as a reserved judgment. It is with this in mind that I reject the argument that the judge ignored or misapprehended evidence because he did not mention certain aspects of the evidence or make specific findings on all points of argument. [17] As I have said, the judge made two crucial findings: Implicit in the first finding is the acceptance of the defendant's evidence that the plaintiff had reached an appropriate level of proficiency and that it had provided him the work experience that was necessary to advance his training. [18] At paragraph 30 of his reasons the judge said: [19] Mr. Robertson was a witness called by the plaintiff as a representative of the Apprenticeship Branch. [20] I interpret the judge's reasons at paragraph [30] above to mean that there was a shared responsibility to inform the Branch of any difficulty in the apprenticeship and that neither party was blameless in that regard. However, he was not satisfied that that amounted to a breach of contract on the part of the defendant. [21] Mr. Robertson gave an opinion that the defendant did not offer the plaintiff sufficient work in the trade to qualify him as a journeyman. But the judge was not bound to accept that opinion. There was evidence supporting the acceptance of the defendant's position on the quality and quantity of the training given to the plaintiff. [22] As Mr. Johnson, counsel for the defendant, argued before us, that conclusion is consistent with the plaintiff's successful completion of his trade school training at Camosun College in each of the previous three years. [23] It would appear that the judge concluded that the plaintiff misapprehended the level of his proficiency and consequently declined the opportunity of completing his apprenticeship with the defendant either at the end of 1995 or at the conclusion of the extended term. [24] One additional aspect of the evidence requires particular mention. Through Mr. Robertson the plaintiff led evidence that on two prior occasions apprentices at the defendant's shop failed to obtain certification at the end of their regular time. Mr. Robertson said that as a result of this experience and the plaintiff's difficulty the Branch declined to authorize any more apprenticeships at the defendant's business. It is said on appeal that the judge ignored this evidence and that had he considered it he could not have found for the defendant on the issue of breach. [25] The judge did not specifically advert to this evidence but, as I have said, because a judge did not mention evidence is not necessarily an indication that the judge ignored it. Moreover, as I will explain, the evidence was not admissible anyway. [26] The witness's testimony on this subject was similar fact evidence. Such evidence can be admissible in a civil case: MacDonald et al v. Canada Kelp Company Ltd. et al , [1973] 5 W.W.R. 689 (B.C.C.A.), but subject to the requirements outlined by Mr. Justice Bull at 699 of Canada Kelp as follows: [27] For a recent example of the application of the similar fact rule in a civil case see Statton v. Johnson (1999), 64 B.C.L.R. (3d) 52 (C.A.). [28] In my opinion the evidence was not presented in an acceptable form. Mr. Robertson gave hearsay evidence about two prior apprenticeships. In order for them to have had any bearing on the present case the plaintiff needed to present direct evidence about their circumstances so the judge could see whether the facts were similar. The judge would then weigh several factors before admitting the evidence as similar facts, not the least of which is whether the case may become bogged down on collateral issues as to what really happened with the other apprentices. In fact, the defendant disputed the allegation that the other apprentices were denied proper training and offered a explanation for the problems that they encountered: in one case the person was fired for insubordination and in the other, the person was only a temporary apprentice whose work was unsatisfactory. [29] The evidence then suffered from two defects: it was hearsay and it was incomplete. There was no admissible similar fact evidence for the judge to consider. [30] Mr. Christie for the plaintiff argued that this was a case of constructive dismissal. I respectfully disagree. The plaintiff was on contract for a definite term with no residual right of employment. The separation occurred within a month or so of the end of the agreement when the plaintiff had decided that he did not wish to continue with the apprenticeship. I am unable to construe the offer to extend the apprenticeship as an alteration of a fundamental term of the agreement because the agreement was about to come to an end in any event. The question whether the defendant would certify the plaintiff relates to the allegation of breach of the apprenticeship contract, not constructive dismissal. [31] In summary, the judge was required to resolve a conflict in the evidence over the adequacy of the plaintiff's training. It is apparent from the reasons for judgment that the judge preferred the employer's version of the circumstances. This was a decision supported by evidence and cannot be reversed on appeal. [32] I would dismiss the appeal. FINCH, J.A.: NEWBURY, J.A.: FINCH, J.A.: \"The Honourable Mr. Justice Donald\"",

In addition, First Global Financial Inc. (\"First Global\") seeks judgment pursuant to Rule 18A on its Counterclaim. The plaintiff Casson & Shpak, a Partnership, (\"Casson & Shpak\") has in turn filed a cross-application pursuant to Rule 18 or 18A seeking judgment and dismissal of the Counterclaim of the defendant First Global. I will briefly review the facts: Casson & Shpak are a firm of chartered accountants who provided accounting services to a company known as Nova Marketing Ltd., now called National Nova Marketing Ltd. (\"Nova\"). As of January 25, l992, Nova owed Casson & Shpak $25,220.66 for accounting services. On that date Casson & Shpak agreed to accept 168,000 common shares in Nova in satisfaction of the debt (\"the Casson & Shpak Shares\"). The parties agree that as of that date the shares were of an uncertain worth since Nova was no longer registered on the Vancouver Stock Exchange and was therefore not trading. On January 25, l992, the plaintiff and First Global entered into a written agreement whereby it was agreed that the plaintiff would keep the Casson & Shpak Shares available for sale to First Global for the sum of $12,500 until July 15, l992 or if $1,000 was paid on or before July 15, l992, until October 15, l992. In consideration, First Global agreed to deliver to the plaintiff its 145,000 shares in Nova (\"the First Global Shares\"). If First Global purchased the Casson & Shpak Shares by October 15, l992, the plaintiff would return the First Global Shares. If First Global failed to purchase the Casson & Shpak Shares by October 15, l992, the First Global Shares would be forfeited to the plaintiff. The agreement stipulated that time was of the essence. The agreement was drafted by Anders (a self-described corporate development consultant) although Mr. Shpak himself made some revisions to the final text. On February 3, l992, in order to assist the plaintiff in being able to freely dispose of the First Global Sshares after October 15, First Global provided the plaintiff with a Power of Attorney which authorized Mr. Shpak to freely dispose of the First Global Shares. I find that it was both agreed and understood between the parties that both the Casson & Shpak Shares and the First Global Shares were to be delivered by Nova to the plaintiff upon their issuance. While the agreement provided that the shares were to be held by the plaintiff in accordance with the terms of the agreement, in fact the defendants obtained both the Casson & Shpak Shares and the First Global Shares and failed to deliver them to the plaintiff. The critical date -- October 15, l992 -- passed with no payment made by First Global in connection with the Casson & Shpak Shares. On October 20, 21 and 22, 1992 the plaintiff demanded that the defendants deliver all of the shares -- that is, both the Casson & Shpak Shares and the First Global Shares -- to the plaintiff. Then, on October 22, l992, Anders attended at the plaintiff's offices with the Casson & Shpak Shares and a certified cheque dated October 21, l992 in the sum of $12,500. Anders refused to give Mr. Shpak the First Global Shares. Anders and Mr. Shpak immediately attended the plaintiff's lawyer's offices where the plaintiff's lawyer informed Anders that as a result of his refusal to deliver the First Global Shares, the cheque for $12,500 would be held as a set-off for damages arising from his wrongful detention of the Shares, but would be returned upon delivery of the First Global Shares. Upon the plaintiff's application, the parties appeared before Madam Justice Allan on November 9, l992. The plaintiff sought the appointment of one of its partners as a receiver for the 145,000 First Global Shares with power to sell them and pay the proceeds into Court pending the resolution of the dispute between the parties. Allan J. appointed Mr. Shpak the receiver of the First Global Shares with power to sell the shares. In accordance with that Order, all of those shares have been sold. Issues : The defendants' application raises three basic issues: (1) First, the defendants submit that by receiving the $12,500 cheque on October 22, l992, the plaintiff thereby waived its right to rely upon that provision in the agreement to the effect that time was of the essence or is estopped from relying upon that provision. (2) The defendants submit that the First Global Shares were only intended to be held as security for the payment of the $12,500. By virtue of its recovery of the Casson & Shpak Shares, the defendants say that the plaintiff is no longer entitled to recovery of the First Global Shares. (3) In the alternative, the defendants say that their failure to pay $12,500 on the date originally agreed, was as a result of inadvertence on their part, and that given the great disparity between the value of the shares forfeited and the actual damage caused by the breach, the Court ought to exercise its equitable jurisdiction, and relieve the defendants against forfeiture of the shares. I will address each matter in turn. (a) Waiver of time of the essence provision : It is not disputed that the agreement in question provided that time was of the essence. The case authorities are clear that a waiver of a contractual term requires an unequivocal intention to relinquish a right, which intention must be consciously communicated. ( F.B.D.B. v. Steinbok Development Corp. (1983), 42 A.R. 231 (C.A.) at p. 236.) The onus of establishing waiver of a provision that time is of the essence is upon the party who asserts the waiver. ( Watts v. Strezos , (1955) 4 D.L.R. 2126 (Ont. H.C.) at 129.) On a review of the affidavits filed, I am not satisfied that there is any evidence that the plaintiff ever waived the time of the essence provision relating to the performance of the agreement. To the contrary, I am satisfied that Mr. Shpak made it clear that he required the delivery of all of the shares and that he was not accepting $12,500 as payment for the Casson & Shpak Shares. Indeed, that advice was immediately repeated in the presence of the plaintiff's lawyer. (b) First Global Shares --held as security only ? This leg of the defendants' submission is somewhat convoluted and unclear. It seems to me that the defendants are essentially arguing that notwithstanding the written contractual provisions, the Court ought to accept Anders' evidence concerning the parties' underlying intentions at the time the agreement was executed. The defendants say that Casson & Shpak was particularly intent upon finding some means to guarantee a $12,500 purchase price for the shares. In this context, they say that the First Global Shares were merely posted as security, \"by way of a collateral agreement\", to guarantee the $12,500 purchase price. Since the Casson & Shpak Shares have been received and sold by the plaintiff, the defendants say that the shares posted as security may now be released back to the defendants. In my view, this argument flies in the face of the clear wording of the agreement and effectively requires that the Court admit parol evidence. Parol evidence is only admissible to explain an ambiguity in the language of a written agreement. Since there is none on the face of the agreement before the Court, it cannot be admitted. Accordingly, this branch of the defendants' submission fails. (c) Relief against Forfeiture : The essence of the defendants' complaint is that by virtue of the forfeiture of the shares, the plaintiff has enjoyed a windfall -- the shares which were thought to perhaps even be worthless at the time the agreement was executed now have a value in the order of $120-140,000. The defendants says that since the object of the initial transaction was simply to secure the payment of the sum of $12,500 in respect of the Casson & Shpak Shares, the Court ought to exercise its equitable jurisdiction and relieve against the forfeiture of the shares resulting from the breach of the covenant concerning payment by a certain date. ( Liscumb v. Provenzano Estate (1985, 40 R.P.R. 31, Ont. S.C.)) In my view, in light of the circumstances here, there is some very grave doubt as to whether the defendants have come to the Court with 'clean hands' and are thereby in any position to seek equitable relief. However, I will not determine the issue on that basis. Rather, as a matter of legal principle, I have concluded the defendants are simply unable to suggest that the forfeiture clause is of a penal nature, in the sense that the sum forfeited is out of all proportion to the damage and that it would accordingly be unconscionable for the plaintiff to retain the property in question.

NAB Holdings Ltd. et al (1986) 6 B.C.L.R. 145 (B.C.C.A.), in proceedings for an order to cancel an agreement for sale, the petitioner sought to include a term that all moneys paid to it on account of the purchase price be forfeited, in accordance with a term in the agreement describing such monies as \"liquidated and ascertained damages\". The Chambers Judge granted the order of cancellation but refused to allow forfeiture of the monies paid, holding that the forfeiture was unconscionable. On appeal, Lambert, J.A. reviewed the case authorities concerning relief against forfeiture and stated at p. 157: \"...So, in summary, relief against forfeiture may be granted under s. 21 of the Law and Equity Act, which, as I have said, merely restates the equitable principles in statutory form. The circumstances under which relief should be granted are where, first, the sum forfeited is out of all proportion to the loss suffered and, second, it is unconscionable to retain the money, in the traditional equitable sense of unconscionability. ... ...So viewed not from the date of the agreement, which is the date for determining whether an ascertained sum is liquidated damages or a penalty, but from the date of the invocation of the clause, which is the date for determining whether relief should be granted against the penalty, it has not been shown that the first condition for relief has been met, namely, that the penal amount is out of all proportion to the loss suffered by B.C.D.C. (My emphasis) In this case, on the date the agreement was executed (January 25, l992), the Casson & Shpak Shares were worth approximately $12,500, less than one-half the debt acknowledged by Nova. The First Global Shares were worth approximately $12,000. The agreement provided that the plaintiff was to hold the shares for ten months. During that time, the shares could, of course, have dropped in value. In consideration for keeping the Casson & Shpak Shares available for sale, the First Global Shares were to be delivered as security for performance. Thus, as of the date of the agreement, I cannot accede to any submission that the forfeiture clause was penal in nature or in any way unconscionable. In my view, there is simply no evidence to support that submission. Conclusion : In the end result, the defendants' applications are dismissed. The evidence, however, supports the plaintiff's cross-application. There will be a declaration that the plaintiff is entitled to claim the proceeds of sale of the First Global Shares. In addition, I am ordering that the defendants' Counterclaim is dismissed. Costs follow the event. \"M.E. Boyd\" M. E. Boyd, J. Vancouver, British Columbia January 5, 1993.",

JUSTICE MEIKLEM BIDERI ) ) RESPONDENT ) Counsel for the Appellant: R. Tyo Counsel for the Respondent: In Person Place and Date of Trial: Prince George, B.C. January 3, 1995 1 This appeal proceeded as a review of the record of the provincial court, including the transcript of the proceedings wherein the appellant's application for maintenance for the child Joshua was dismissed. 2 The evidence before the learned provincial court judge on the issue of paternity included the applicant's testimony that she and the respondent had sexual intercourse six or seven times in late November and December 1992. She admitted that he used condoms \"almost all the time\" but said \"there were times when there was no condom used, but there would have been condoms earlier that night.\" She testified that she had had no intercourse with any other man than John Bidera between September of 1992 and December 1993. Her last menstrual period prior to pregnancy was in November of 1992. 3 Mr. Bidera's evidence was that he had intercourse with Ms. Carriere three times, and on all occasions wore a condom. The results of DNA Paternity testing using samples taken from the child Joshua, the Caucasian applicant, and the respondent, a black, were set out in a certificate from International Helix Biotechnologies Inc. This certified that the probability of the respondent's paternity was \"99.98% as compared to an untested, random man of the North American Black population\". 4 The learned trial judge commented in her reasons that \"Mr. Bidera on his evidence is originally from Rwanda\". It was correctly pointed out on the appeal that no evidence of Mr. Bidera's point of origin was contained within his sworn testimony, but rather in dialogue between submissions of counsel. I do not attach much significance to this error, standing alone, for the purposes of this appeal. The evidence did include a reference by Mr. Bidera to his mother being in Africa, from which an inference might reasonably be drawn that he was not from the North American Black population, and apparently no objection was made at trial to that submission being considered evidence. 5 The learned trial judge's reasons summarize the relevant testimony without commenting on credibility. No findings of fact were stated other than what might be implied from this comment near the closing of the evidence: THE COURT: Well, Mr. Bidera said that was the reason he used the condom. Whether, in fact, he's right and your client was using drugs, or she's right and there were other people in the apartment using drugs, the real question is, was he wearing a condom? And I'm satisfied on that question that he was. 6 It is unclear whether this finding pertains to one occasion of intercourse (reference to \" the condom\") or all occasions, because the reasons contain the comment \"even if I accept that a condom was used on all occasions, they are not one hundred percent effective in preventing pregnancy\". This latter comment tends to indicate the earlier finding was limited to a particular single occasion. 7 It is also unclear from the reasons for judgment how or why the applicant's uncontradicted, and unchallenged evidence that Mr. Bidera was her only sexual partner from her last menstruation to following the birth of the child, was discounted. 8 The learned trial judge was primarily concerned with the issue that arose from her own astuteness in noticing that the database of the North American Black population was not necessarily applicable to a man from Africa. This issue was not raised by counsel and, as commented upon by the trial judge, no evidence was tendered as to how this might affect the test results. It is not entirely clear whether the trial judge considered the paternity test to be simply of no probative value or whether she considered the probability of paternity, stated to be 99.98% using a database of North American Blacks, to be reduced below 50% by virtue of this misstatement. Reference is made in the reasons to the fact that the trial judge attended a course on DNA testing where: \"the instructors discussed the difficulty of dealing with the sort of issue that has just been raised here\", but no analysis of the issue is made. 9 The trial judge's reasons conclude: The conclusion that I reach is that there certainly is a chance that Mr. Bidera is the father of this child, but the test is a balance of probabilities, and on a balance of probabilities, I am not satisfied that he is the father.\" I can only assume that the paternity test was accorded no weight or only trifling weight. 10 This matter affects the welfare of a child. Even if the paternity test was treated as having trifling weight, the evidence of the mother was uncontradicted as to other possible fathers and she was not confronted in cross-examination on this point. If her evidence on this point was accepted, there could be no doubt as to paternity. If, as seems to be the case, her evidence was not accepted, it is incumbent upon the trial judge in these circumstances to say so, and to state reasons, even if the reason be as brief as to state the witness is not believable. 11 In the matter of the discovered weakness in the paternity test results, it is my view that when an issue such as this arises for the first time at trial, at the instance of the judge, in such an important matter as the long term welfare of a child, an opportunity should have been afforded to the parties to adduce evidence on the issue raised. The indicated probability of paternity of 99.98% was overwhelmingly past \"the balance\" point, and was corroborated by other evidence. In my view the learned trial judge erred in discounting the paternity test evidence on a point raised by herself without affording the parties an opportunity to adduce the clarifying evidence she acknowledged was needed. 12 No new evidence was adduced on appeal, but counsel advise that evidence is available that the change in probability of paternity arising from the DNA testing using the properly applicable data base is insignificant. 13 The appeal is allowed and a new hearing is ordered. \"I.

        "text": " No. V01120 Victoria Registry Court of Appeal for British Columbia BETWEEN: ) ) ATTORNEY GENERAL OF CANADA ) REASONS FOR JUDGMENT ) PLAINTIFF ) (RESPONDENT) ) ) OF THE HONOURABLE AND: ) ) JOSEPHINE LAVERY ) ) MR. JUSTICE TAYLOR DEFENDANT ) (APPELLANT) ) Before: The Honourable The Chief Justice The Honourable Mr. Justice Taylor The Honourable Mr. Justice Wood Michael D. Adlem Counsel for the Appellant Randall W. Callan Counsel for the Respondent Place and Date of Hearing Victoria, British Columbia November 22, 1990 Place and Date of Judgment Vancouver, British Columbia January 2, 1991 FOR THE COURT The principal question raised on this appeal is whether a 1988 amendment to the Law and Equity Act , R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 224, by which the action per quod servitium amisit was abolished should be given retrospective effect, so as to operate as a bar to the continuation of an action already in progress. (a) The Background The claim was brought by the federal Crown, more than a year before the abolition section came into effect, against a driver involved in a motor vehicle accident in which a soldier, Cpl. Richard Hodges, was injured. Cpl. Hodges was treated in part by military medical personnel in military facilities, and in part by civilian personnel and in civilian facilities. The Crown seeks to recover his pay during his period of disability prior to discharge, the cost of his civilian treatment and the \"value\" of the treatment he was given by military medical personnel and in military facilities. The defendant driver denies responsibility for the accident, pleads Section 59 of the Law and Equity Act by which the right of action per quod servitium amisit was abolished, and says that if the Crown has a claim, despite Section 59, it does not include recovery of the value of medical treatment provided by personnel employed by the Crown or the use of government facilities. The defendant says the claim, if there is one, is restricted to recovery of the serviceman's pay and money actually paid by the federal Crown to others for his treatment. The two questions--whether the present action is statute-barred, and, if not, whether it extends to recovery of the disputed medical costs--were set down for determination on agreed facts prior to trial of issues relating to the accident itself. Mr. Justice Callaghan decided both questions in favour of the Crown, and the defendant now appeals. (b) Retrospective Operation Section 59 of the Law and Equity Act , which came into effect by proclamation on October 7, 1988, more than a year after this action was commenced, says: No action is maintainable for damages for loss of servitium and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the action per quod servitium amisit is abolished. It is, of course, a well-established principle that statutory provisions which curtail or extinguish substantive rights are presumed not to have retrospective effect unless that intention is clearly apparent, or arises by necessary implication, from the language adopted by the legislature. At its narrowest, the question raised in the present case is whether the expression \"no action is maintainable\" with which the section opens means 'no action may hereafter be commenced', on the one hand, or 'no action may hereafter be continued or commenced' on the other. To \"maintain\" an action means to carry it on, and in an appropriate context may refer to actions already in progress. But the law must lean against such an interpretation in the present context. The simple statement that \"the action per quod servitium amisit is abolished\", without more, is, in my view, clearly inadequate to overcome the presumption. The purpose of rules of restrictive interpretation of this sort is not to 'cut down' the effect of a legislative enactment. It is to guard against the danger of giving to words of the legislature wider effect than the legislators may in fact have intended. Where rights are to be taken away, the court must be satisfied that the mind of the draftsman, and therefore of the legislators, was indeed directed to the point before giving retrospective effect to such a change--that is to say, the court must be satisfied that the legislators did indeed intend to take away rights already 'vested'. I find myself in agreement with Mr. Justice Callaghan's analysis of the authorities. It seems to me that the use of the words \"no action is maintainable\" should be taken to mean that no action may be brought, rather than that no such action may be continued, including one already commenced. But I think the statutory wording inadequate even to bar an action thereafter commenced where the cause of the action accrued prior to the date on which the section came into effect. In my view the section bars only the bringing of actions in respect of causes of action which would otherwise have arisen after its proclamation. The force of the presumption against retrospectivity has recently been emphasized by the Supreme Court of Canada in Angus v. Sun Life Insurance Co. , [1988] 2 S.C.R. 256. The question there was whether the repeal by the Ontario Family Law Reform Act , S.O. 1975, c. 41, of Section 7 of the Ontario Married Woman's Property Act , R.S.O. 1970, c. 224, which prohibited most inter-spousal tort actions, considered with the provisions of Section 1 of the 1975 Act by which spouses are declared entitled to sue each other in tort, operates so as to prevent a spouse from raising such a defence in an action for negligence brought after the statutory change but in respect of a cause of action which predated it. As in the case of the enactment here in issue, the relevant language of Section 2 of the 1975 Ontario statute speaks wholly in the present tense: I. --(1) For all purposes of the law of Ontario, a married man has a legal personality that is independent, separate and distinct from that of his wife and a married woman has a legal personality that is independent, separate and distinct from that of her husband. . . . (3) Without limiting the generality of subsections (1) and (2), (a) each of the parties to a marriage has the like right of action in tort against the other as if they were not married. Mr. Justice La Forest, giving the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada, having rejected the contention that the change should be considered procedural and for that reason given retrospective effect, went on to say (at page 266): The rule against retrospective application should certainly have effect in a context such as the present one where a party is deprived of a defence to an action by the operation of the new statute; see Foy v. Foy (1978), 20 O.R. (2d) 747 (C.A.), at pp. 747-48 per Jessup J.A. in obiter . This is the whole point of the presumption. The law is leery of retrospective legislation to begin with; the legislature will not lightly be presumed to have intended a provision to have retrospective effect when the provision substantially affects the vested rights of a party. . . . It is not necessary here to untangle the complex distinctions between substantive and procedural legislative provisions. The provision in this case is clearly substantive. In any case, whether the provision is deemed to be substantive or procedural, it is not one to which a presumption of retrospectivity can be applied. This would amount to a serious deprivation of an acquired right of the husband, and it should not lightly be assumed that this was the intention of the legislature. Later in his judgment Mr. Justice La Forest points out (at p. 269) the special importance of the presumption in a world in which insurance coverage and insurance rates are determined on the basis of the rights of action and defences which are available at the time that the coverage is taken out. From that decision, and other cases cited, I take it to be the law that in order to have effect with respect to causes of action which are already in existence, statutory provisions destroying rights of action or defences must be expressly stated to have that effect--something which can quite simply be said--or be cast in language from which such an intention is necessarily apparent, and that no implication to that effect is normally to be drawn merely from the fact that the statutory language is in the present tense so as to show that the provision takes effect as at the moment of proclamation. An intention that such a provision have immediate effect, without more, will, in the case of wording such as here used, normally be taken to mean only that the provision has effect with respect to rights which thereafter come into existence, or would otherwise have come into existence. I am accordingly of the view that the right of action per quod servitium amisit asserted in this case was not taken away by Section 59 of the Law and Equity Act . (c) Recovery for Medical Treatment The second point raised is concerned with whether the scope of recovery in this action extends beyond a right to recover wages paid by the employer to the employee, and money paid by the employer to others for the employee's treatment, and includes also a right to compensation for the use of the services of the employer's own salaried medical personnel and of the employer's own medical or other facilities. The claim in respect of services rendered to Cpl. Hodges by military medical personnel and in military hospital and other facilities is not put on the basis that extra cost was imposed on the Crown as a result of his treatment--the personnel and facilities would have been employed and maintained by the Crown in any event. No claim is made for loss of profit or loss of opportunity for profitable use. No authority was cited for the proposition that such compensation is recoverable in an action per quod servitium amisit . The learned judge referred to cases in which an allowance has been made for the benefit of a parent who has provided care, and to the statement of Mr. Justice Judson in A.G. Canada v. Nykorak (1962) 37 W.W.R. 660 (S.C.C.) (at p. 644) that \"it is not cheaper to injure a soldier than a civilian because the Crown assumes to look after a soldier during his period of disability\". But it seems to me that the claim in question is not really analogous to that of a parent or other relative who has devoted time to the giving of care, time which would otherwise have been devoted to other activities. Here the personnel and equipment involved were provided for the very purpose of giving care and treatment and would have been so provided whether or not Cpl. Hodges was injured. I am also of the view that considerations related to a desire \"to see that the wrongdoer pays\" are not today normally considered relevant to the resolution of compensatory damage issues arising in actions for negligence. To grant compensation for the use of Crown medical personnel and facilities in this case would, in my view, be to extend the scope of recovery in the action per quod servitium amisit beyond the area hitherto recognized, and to do so at a time when the right of action has fallen into such disfavour as to lead to its legislative abolition: see R. v. Buchinsky , [1983] 1 S.C.R. 481, A.G. Canada v. Szaniszlo (1985), 69 B.C.L.R. 96 (S.C.); Report on the Action Per Quod Servitium Amisit , Law Reform Commission of B.C., November 1986. I find no justification in these circumstances for permitting recovery for medical and other services provided by medical personnel employed by the federal Crown or through the use of facilities operated by the federal Crown. (d) Conclusion I would affirm the decision of the chambers judge that the present action can be continued, and would not allow the appeal on that issue. I would hold that the sum of $129,229 referred to in paragraph 4 on page 10 of the Statement of Facts cannot, however, be recovered in the action, and in that regard only would allow the appeal. I would direct that costs of the application, here and below, be in the cause. \"The Honourable Mr. Justice Taylor\" I AGREE: The Honourable The Chief Justice I AGREE: The Honourable Mr. Justice Wood",

        "text": " CA013228 Vancouver Registry Court of Appeal for British Columbia ORAL REASONS FOR JUDGMENT : BEFORE THE HONOURABLE January 30, 1991 MR. JUSTICE MACFARLANE IN CHAMBERS Vancouver, B.C. BETWEEN: ATTORNEY GENERAL OF BRITISH COLUMBIA and HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IN RIGHT OF THE PROVINCE OF BRITISH COLUMBIA PLAINTIFF (RESPONDENT) AND: CHIEF FRASER ANDREW, as representative of the Band Council and members of the Mount Currie Indian Band, MOUNT CURRIE INDIAN Band, and TERRI JOHN, RALPH DAN, RON DAN, ALVIN NELSON, ALBERT PASCAL and JOHN DOE as individuals and as representatives of persons blocking a road known as \"Lillooet Lake Road\" DEFENDANTS (APPELLANTS) Bruce Clark appearing for the Appellants, Terri John, Ralph Dan, Ron Dan, Alvin Nelson, Albert Pascal and John Doe Leslie Pinder appearing for the Appellants, Chief Fraser Andrew, as representative of the Band Council and members of the Mount Currie Indian Band D.M. Goldie, Q.C. and appearing for the Respondent J.M. MacKenzie (application for leave to appeal) MACFARLANE, J.A.: This is an application for leave to appeal an interlocutory injunction granted by Chief Justice Esson on October 30, 1990. The order provided inter alia : AND THIS COURT FURTHER ORDERS that until further Order of this Court, Chief Fraser Andrew and all other persons to whose notice this Order may come, are enjoined from obstructing or otherwise hindering the flow of traffic on Lillooet Lake Road (also known as \"Duffy Lake Road\" and \"Pemberton-Lillooet Road\"): AND THIS COURT FURTHER ORDERS that the undertaking normally required by Rule 45(6) is dispensed with: AND THIS COURT FURTHER ORDERS that all parties shall be at liberty to apply to this Honourable Court as to other matters which may arise in connection with this Order. It is to be noted that no order was made by Chief Justice Esson against these applicants, although they may be directly affected and probably are directly affected by it. Chief Justice Esson said on p.41 of his reasons: The order in the terms of Clauses 1 and 5 will be against Chief Andrew as representative of the Band Council and members of the Band. In view of the uncertainty as to service and as to the necessity for such an order, I make no order against the other defendants but that aspect of the application is adjourned. If the plaintiffs seek an injunction against those individuals, that may be spoken to. There will be liberty to apply as to other matters which may arise. On p.2 of his reasons Chief Justice Esson had said this with respect to the applicants: None of the individual defendants Terri John, Ralph Dan, Ron Dan, Alvin Nelson and Albert Pascal, have entered appearances. Some of them have not been served but I am satisfied that they are all aware of these proceedings. The applicants are said to have had notice of the injunction and to have disobeyed it. They are now facing contempt charges in a proceeding before Macdonald, J. They have never applied to set aside or vary the order of Chief Justice Esson and the question which they now raise has never been argued before Chief Justice Esson. It is submitted on behalf of the applicants that despite the fact that the matter has not been argued before Chief Justice Esson that when it was raised on a subsidiary application the Chief Justice said that the sovereignty question could not be supported in law. Counsel have also referred me to comments by Chief Justice Esson to the effect that the issue had not been argued before him and that he had not decided it. The applicants have now entered appearances and have filed a statement of defence and counter-claim in the trial proceedings. Counsel tells me that those pleadings raise the issue which is now put before me. No effort has been made to have the question of law based on those pleadings argued and decided at the trial level. The proposition which the applicants assert may be summarized in this way: The Supreme Court of British Columbia is without jurisdiction over the Lil'wat Aboriginal People (of which the applicants form part) because the Lil'wat People constitute a sovereign nation to which the laws of Canada do not apply and over which the Courts have no jurisdiction, specifically within the territory in question. Counsel for the applicants submits that the narrow question is whether s.8 of the Supreme Court Act applies to these applicants. In my view that must necessarily involve answering the Indian sovereignty question which I have just summarized. The motion before this Court also indicates that if leave be granted an application will be made to permit the appellants to adduce fresh evidence at the hearing of the appeal. But counsel for the applicants now asserts that this is a pure law issue not requiring evidence. Counsel for the Province submits that the applicants have no reasonable prospect of success on the sovereignty argument. He refers to R. v. Sparrow , (1989) 1 S.C.R. 1075 and particularly to what was said by Chief Justice Dickson at p.1103: It is worth recalling that while British policy towards the native population was based on respect for their right to occupy their traditional lands, a proposition to which the Royal Proclamation of 1763 bears witness, there was from the outset never any doubt that sovereignty and legislative power, and indeed the underlying title, to such lands vested in the Crown -- Counsel for the applicant submits that the jurisdictional issue and the Indian sovereignty question now raised has not been directly decided by the Supreme Court of Canada. Counsel for the respondent asserts that it is implicit in Sparrow that the Court held that Indian rights are a justiciable issue. Certainly the number of Indian rights cases that have gone to this Court and to the Supreme Court of Canada indicate that up until now the Indians involved in these cases had considered that the Courts had jurisdiction in matters pertaining to them. The merits of the issues raised by the applicants have been argued on this application but it is not necessary for me to decide the application on that basis. I would observe however that the proposition that Indians are not subject to the laws of Canada or to the jurisdiction of Canadian Courts is a novel one. Indians have been recognized as having special rights. Doubts over the interpretation of statutes are resolved in their favour. Some of their interests have been held to be paramount to others: See Sparrow . But, in the end they have always been regarded as citizens of Canada with all of the rights and obligations of citizens although they often assert, and sometimes correctly, that their rights have not always been properly recognized. How then can it be successfully argued that they are not subject to the laws of Canada and to the jurisdiction of our Courts? I need not answer the question. There is no doubt that if the argument has any chance of success it is one of great complexity involving a consideration of the origins of the people involved and a historical analysis which undoubtedly give rise to conflicting expert opinions. The solicitor for the Lil'wat Aboriginal People says in an affidavit that her client's case rests on a book by Bruce Clark, now counsel for the applicants. The book, Native Liberty, Crown Sovereignty: The Existing Aboriginal Right of Self-Government in Canada (Montreal and Kingston, McGill - Queen's University Press, 1990), which is 203 pages in length and contains an extensive appendix, bibliography, and index is a clear indication of the complexity of the subject. But, it is a thesis which will inevitably be attacked by other experts whose opinions will have to be taken into account before this issue is resolved. In my opinion, the proper place for that to be done is in the trial court. Mr. Goldie for the Provincial Crown suggests that the issue may be resolved on an application to set aside or vary the order in question. If the question can proceed on agreed facts and involves only a point of law it may be set down as such. If it requires evidence which needs to be considered at trial then it may be dealt with in that fashion. I do not suggest what procedure may be appropriate but I think that the question is one to which the trial process should be applied. The danger of deciding constitutional questions at the interlocutory stage was discussed in Manitoba (Attorney General) v. Metropolitan Stores Limited (1987) 1 S.C.R. 110 at 130-133. The essential need to establish the factual basis in the Charter cases was emphasised in MacKay v. Manitoba [1989] 2 S.C.R. 357 at 361-3. At p.361-2, Mr. Justice Cory said this: Charter decisions should not and must not be made in a factual vacuum. To attempt to do so would trivialize the Charter and inevitably result in ill-considered opinions. The presentation of facts is not, as stated by the respondent, a mere technicality; rather, it is essential to a proper consideration of Charter issues. A respondent cannot, by simply consenting to dispense with the factual background, require or expect a court to deal with an issue such as this in a factual void. Charter decisions cannot be based upon the unsupported hypotheses of enthusiastic counsel. The need to ensure a proper factual foundation exists in Charter cases was discussed further in Danson v. Ontario (Attorney General) (1990); 112 N.R. 362 at 375-379. In that case, Mr. Justice Sopinka quoted what I have just taken from Mr. Justice Cory's judgment in MacKay and also had regard to other portions of his opinion. I recognize that a firm factual basis is needed in Charter cases and particularly before a s.1 analysis is undertaken. That need is not to be found in this case, but the caution expressed in Metropolitan Stores is not limited to Charter or constitutional cases but to all decisions at the interlocutory stage. In this case we are dealing with the granting of an interlocutory injunction. Serious constitutional questions are said to arise if the applicants press the point that they have argued before me. If that is so then any decision must be carefully considered as it will profoundly affect the lives of Canadians and all residents of Canada: MacKay v. Manitoba . In particular, the concept of Indian sovereignty, depending as it must, on historical analysis and documentary interpretation must to a great extent, I think, depend upon evidence. The proper way in which to develop the appropriate background for the consideration of the question is to be found in applying the trial process. For those reasons I would refuse leave to appeal.

Kelly Counsel for the Appellant R.B. Caryer Counsel for the Attorney General of British Columbia M. Acheson Counsel for the Forensic Psychiatric Services Commission B.T. Gibson Counsel for the Vancouver Sun D. Burnett Counsel for CKNW Place and Date of Hearing Vancouver, British Columbia December 14, 1992 Place and Date of Judgment Vancouver, British Columbia January 18, 1993 Written Reasons by: The Honourable Madam Justice Proudfoot (In Chambers) Court of Appeal for British Columbia Bruce Blackman - v. - Attorney General of British Columbia and Forensic Psychiatric Services Commission Reasons for Judgment of the Honourable Madam Justice Proudfoot (In Chambers) 1 This is an appeal from the British Columbia Board of Review pursuant to Section 672.72(1) of Part XX.1 of the Criminal Code . 2 The appellant applies for direction pursuant to Section 6(1)(d) of the Court of Appeal Act . 3 The appellant, Bruce Blackman, requested the British Columbia Board of Review to make an order excluding the public from his annual review under Section 672.5(6) of the Criminal Code . 4 The Board denied the exclusion order with a disposition stating that \"any evidence either written or oral given during the course of a hearing in which an application to exclude all or any member of the public is made cannot be the subject of an exclusion order\". 5 It is that order which Blackman appeals. 6 The issue whether this court has jurisdiction under Section 672.72(1) of the Criminal Code to entertain an appeal of a Review Board decision. 7 The decision of the Review Board was that evidence given during the course of a hearing of an application to exclude the public cannot be the subject of an exclusion order. 8 The court's jurisdiction must be found in Section 672.72(1) and that provision provides as follows: Any party may appeal against a disposition or placement decision made by a court or Review Board to the court of appeal of the province where the disposition or placement decision was made on any ground of appeal that raises a question of law or fact alone or mixed law and fact. 9 The ruling made by the Board must fall within the definition of either a \"disposition\" or a \"placement decision\". It can readily be seen that the ruling is not a \"placement decision\" as defined in Section 672.1. Is it then a \"disposition\"? 10 A disposition in Part XX.1 of the Criminal Code is an order made by the Review Board under Section 672.54 or an order made by a court under Section 672.58. The latter is not applicable. The former provides as follows: 672.54 Where a court or Review Board makes a disposition pursuant to subsection 672.45(2) or section 672.47, it shall, taking into consideration the need to protect the public from dangerous persons, the mental condition of the accused, the reintegration of the accused into society and the other needs of the accused, make one of the following dispositions that is the least onerous and least restrictive to the accused: (a) where a verdict of not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder has been rendered in respect of the accused and, in the opinion of the court or Review Board, the accused is not a significant threat to the safety of the public, by order, direct that the accused be discharged absolutely; (b) by order, direct that the accused be discharged subject to such conditions as the court or Review Board considers appropriate; or (c) by order, direct that the accused be detained in custody in a hospital, subject to such conditions as the court or Review Board considers appropriate. 11 In my view, it is clear that the order made by the Board does not fall into that section. That section clearly deals with either a discharge order or one that detains the applicant. A non-exclusion order, such as was made in the case at bar, does not deal with either a discharge or a detention. 12 The second ground the applicant advances, if I understand the argument, is that the final words of Section 672.72(1) \"any ground of appeal that raises a question of law or fact alone or of mixed law and fact\" expands the definition of disposition so as to include the type of ruling made by the Board, i.e., that certain evidence at the hearing of the Board of Review is not subject to a non-exclusion order. 13 I am not persuaded that the definition of disposition is expanded to the extent as argued by the appellant. These words set the parameters of the court's jurisdiction to hear appeals of the Review Board rulings. The appellate court's usual role is to review questions of law and not questions of fact (see the case of Prudential Trust Co. Ltd. v. Forseth , [1960] S.C.R. 210, 21 D.L.R. (2d) 587). Section 672.72.(1) simply makes it clear that an appeal of a \"disposition\" or \"placement decision\" is not confined to errors of law but may consist of questions of fact or mixed law and fact. It does not, in my view, in any way extend or expand the definition of a \"disposition\" or \"placement decision\". 14 The final argument the appellant makes is that Part XX.1 of the Criminal Code is not exclusively criminal and that accordingly, the Crown's authorities of Regina v. Needham (4 May 1992), Vancouver 013734 (B.C.C.A.) and Regina v. Lawrence (13 January 1992), Vancouver 014724 (B.C.C.A.) have no application. In my view, that argument cannot succeed. First, the law is clear that criminal appeals must find their origin in a statute. Authority for this is Regina v. Mills (1986), 26 C.C.C. (3d) 481 at 495. 15 Part XX.1 of the Criminal Code sets out the statutory procedure to deal with a person acquitted of a crime due to insanity. Although he or she may have been acquitted, these persons are nevertheless subject to spending a period of time in custody (in many instances, long periods of time) which Parliament has decided is an appropriate resolution. 16 The two cases put forward by the Crown support the proposition that this is a criminal matter and must be dealt with on a statutory level within Part XX.1 of the Criminal Code . 17 In the Needham case, several bans on publication were ordered during the course of a trial. The newspaper reporter filed a petition seeking the submissions and reasons for those orders. The petition was dismissed by the trial judge. The argument was that the petition commenced a \"civil proceeding\" and because the dismissal was a final order against the newspaper reporter, a right of appeal under Section 6(1) of the Court of Appeal Act was available. The Court of Appeal rejected that argument and concluded that the orders made during the course of a criminal trial, of an interlocutory nature and that an appeal was only available from a conviction or acquittal. 18 In Lawrence , the Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal an order made at a pre-hearing conference pursuant to Section 625.1(2) of the Criminal Code . Hinds, J.A., concluded that the pre-hearing conference \"was clearly a proceeding in respect of the indictable offences with which the respondents were charged\". It was an interlocutory order and the court could not entertain an appeal from that order. 19 In my view, the order made by the Review Board is an interlocutory order made as part of a criminal proceeding. Accordingly, the question of appealing that order must be determined by the statute specifically Part XX.1 of the Criminal Code , Section 672.72(1). 20 In conclusion, the Review Board decision is not a \"disposition\" or \"placement decision\" which can be appealed to this court within that section. 21 This court does not have jurisdiction to deal with this application. \"The Honourable Madam Justice Proudfoot\"",

JUSTICE SIGURDSON Counsel for the Petitioner: Richard Fyfe and George Copley Counsel for the Respondents: Louise Mandell, Q.C. and R. M. Mogerman Place and Date of Hearing: Kelowna, British Columbia December 20, 1999 Counsel for the Petitioner: Richard Fyfe and George Copley Counsel for the Respondents: Louise Mandell, Q.C. and R. M. Mogerman Place and Date of Hearing: Kelowna, British Columbia December 20, 1999 INTRODUCTION [1] These proceedings concern timber the respondents had been cutting. On November 12, 1999, I granted injunctions preventing further logging pending the resolution of these disputes. Cut timber remains on the ground. [2] Both parties apply under Rules 46 and 43. They agree that an order ought to be made providing for the timber to be removed and sold but each side has a different view of the appropriate order. PARTIES' POSITIONS (a) Crown's position [3] The Ministry of Forests says that it should arrange to have the logs skidded, decked, transported and scaled and will undertake the ripping of any landings, the deactivation of any roads and trails used for skidding and transporting lumber. It will be responsible for fire hazard disposal and other prescribed silviculture treatments. The Ministry of Forests will arrange a competitive sale of the timber and provide an accounting to the court for the costs of skidding, decking, transporting, scaling and the sale of timber, fire abatement and other costs including silviculture treatment. After deducting the amount of stumpage and the Ministry of Forests' costs for the aforementioned activities, the Crown proposes that the balance of monies be paid into court. The Crown submits that the respondents' costs for cutting timber should not be paid. (b) Respondents' proposal [4] The cut timber will be removed from its present locations in accordance with a plan to be agreed to between the parties. The plan will include the following terms: the respondents will buck and skid the trees, build landings, truck the trees to a mill and replant the logged area; enough of the milled wood will be sold to pay the costs of the parties and the remaining wood will be valued and its value paid to the successful party, but in the interim the respondents may use milled wood for constructing housing for band members. The respondents propose that if agreement cannot be reached or mediated with respect to any aspect of the plan, the parties shall have liberty to apply for further directions. APPLICABLE LAW [5] Rule 43(1) provides: [6] These rules were considered in McLeod Lake Indian Band v. British Columbia , [1989] B.C.J. No. 467 (Q.L.) (B.C.S.C.), by Chief Justice McLachlin of this Court (as she then was). The band applied for an order permitting them to remove certain logs to which they claimed title. In that case, the band also logged without permit or licence. Chief Justice McLachlin said the purpose of the logging was to provoke the Crown into challenging, via legal proceedings, the band's rights to the lands in question. There, like here, the timber remained lying in the forest and the parties agreed that it was perishable and must be removed (although they did not agree on the timing). In that case, the band applied to remove and salvage, while the Province sought permission to award the contract to remove the timber to the highest bidder. Chief Justice McLachlin said: [7] Both Rules 43 and 46 are applicable to the case at hand. Here, an order must be made that provides for the removal and sale of the timber and due to the potential deterioration of the logs, that order can not await the outcome of this litigation. [8] In crafting the terms of an order under Rule 43, and it seems to me Rule 46, the Court should fix the terms and conditions which will be most beneficial to the parties as a whole: Jabs Construction Ltd. vs. Callahan, [1991] B.C.J. No. 3396 (Q.L.) (B.C.S.C.). The Crown, however, argued that to permit the respondents to remove the logs would allow them to profit from their own wrong inasmuch as they were not authorized to cut the logs in the first place. Mr. Fyfe further argued that if I made the order, at least in part, sought by the respondents, there would be a flood of similar applications. By this, I took him to mean people benefiting from extensive logging done without a permit. However, I think that is unlikely. If there is such logging in the province, there is no reason why the petitioner could not apply promptly to enjoin it. [9] In McLeod Lake Indian Band , it was also argued that allowing the band to remove the timber would enable it to benefit from its own wrong. That argument does not provide an appropriate basis upon which to dismiss the respondents' application in this case for several reasons. First, there is a serious question to be tried between these parties concerning the respondents' right to log. Second, it has not been suggested that when the respondents cut the timber, it violated existing environmental and silviculture requirements. Third, and most importantly in my view, since the injunctions were issued, the respondents, to my knowledge, have complied with them. Echoing Chief Justice McLachlin in McLeod Lake Indian Band , I am also not convinced that permitting the respondents to remove the logs on appropriate terms would amount to allowing them to profit from their own wrong. DISCUSSION [10] There is a significantly greater volume of logs in the Adams Lake proceeding, i.e. about 80 truckloads of logs. In the Okanagan Indian Band case, there are only about five truckloads of logs to be removed. [11] The order that I think does justice between the parties and preserves the proceeds of the subject matter pending resolution of this dispute is as follows. [12] The respondents should be permitted to buck and skid the trees, build the necessary landings and truck the trees from their present location to a mill and then replant the area in question. It was not suggested that the respondents did not have the expertise to do this. The bands, as they cut the logs, can best locate the logs, a fact that may be of assistance if the removal takes place when there is significant snow. The Province argued that this work should be awarded by public tender with the costs so determined. I direct that the respondents be entitled to charge a reasonable amount for this work, at a cost to be determined and agreed between the parties. The petitioner has access to recent information regarding the cost of removing logs and taking them to mills and I think the reasonableness of the respondents' costs can be measured against these usual costs. I believe that the Province has a good idea what current reasonable costs for this work are. I anticipate that the parties will have little trouble agreeing on those reasonable costs but there shall be liberty to apply to fix them if the parties cannot agree. [13] Much of the debate at the hearing concerned not only who should remove the logs but also when the logs had to be, and ought to be, removed. The logs in the forest are infested with beetles and if the logs remain too long on the forest floor, they will be susceptible to insect damage, cracking and blue stain. There is a debate in the affidavit material as to the appropriate time to remove the logs and replant the area. The Crown says that there is no urgency to remove the logs over the winter period, that it is unwise to remove them in the immediate future but that May or June is the absolute deadline. In light of the fact that planning must be done before removing the logs, something which both parties feel is necessary, I think it is expedient to make an order at this time. [14] The question of replanting and meeting silviculture requirements is also in issue, and, although the respondents intend to meet the petitioner's minimal requirements, they claim to intend to do more than satisfy the existing requirements. [15] I have read the affidavits filed by both sides on the questions of the optimum time to remove the logs, taking into account the risks to the timber and the environment. Both sides are evidently alive to the issues that must be considered when deciding when and how to remove the timber. The affidavit material demonstrates, in my view, that the petitioner has broader expertise in connection with these issues, which is not surprising given its overall responsibility for the management of the forests in this province. Consequently, I think that it is appropriate, given the petitioner's regulatory responsibility and expertise, that the question of the timing and manner of the removal of any logs and any necessary steps required for the silviculture prescription, including replanting, be at the direction of the petitioner after the parties have consulted. In terms of supervision, I was informed by Ms. Mandell that the hauling can easily be supervised by the petitioner but the real issue is reforestation, an area where the bands want to consult with other people, not just timber experts. I direct that the respondents, in removing the logs, comply with the terms of the Forest Practices Code and the silviculture prescription for the areas in question. This should not prevent the respondents from taking steps that are in excess of these requirements. I leave this matter to be agreed upon by the parties. Again, if the parties are unable to agree, they may apply for directions. [16] Once the timber is sold, the issue arises as to what expenses are to be deducted and what is to be done with the net proceeds or the milled lumber in lieu of those proceeds in the interim. I think that it is just that both parties' costs incurred in connection with the logging to date be deducted from the proceeds including stumpage. Again, if the parties cannot agree on the amount of those reasonable costs, they will have liberty to apply to me to settle them. [17] The question then becomes what to do with the net proceeds in the interim. The bands suggest that an order ought to be made that the proceeds or, in fact, the milled timber be used for housing for band members, who according to the affidavit material have a pressing need. I recognize that the bands have a need for money or timber to help address their urgent need for better and additional housing for its members. However, the entitlement to the timber or the proceeds from the sale of the timber is at this stage very much in issue. The respondents may ultimately be successful but they may, as well, be unsuccessful. Further, there is no suggestion that an undertaking as to damages from the respondents would provide adequate security in these particular circumstances. [18] Accordingly, in the absence of an agreement between the parties that the timber or proceeds may be used for housing, I will make, what I think is, the usual interlocutory order when the ownership of property is in question. I order that the net proceeds generated from the sale of the logs be held in trust with the respondents' lawyers pending the outcome of this litigation. [19] If the parties are unable to reach any of the agreements that this order contemplates, they shall have liberty to apply for further directions. \"Sigurdson J\" January 6, 2000 -- Corrigendum to paragraph 8 changing word from \"floodgate\" to \"flood\"",

BETWEEN: CHRIS ALEXANDER BAJKOV, an Infant, by his Guardian Ad Litem, BARBARA BAJKOV, and the said BARBARA BAJKOV PLAINTIFFS (APPELLANTS) AND: MARIO ERNEST CANIL and BARBARA CANIL DEFENDANTS (RESPONDENTS) J. Vanstone, Esq. appearing for the Appellant F.H. Saunders, Esq. appearing for the Respondent HINKSON, J.A.: This is an appeal from the decision of a trial judge in which he held that as a result of an accident involving the plaintiff who was riding a bicycle and the defendant who was operating a truck, that each was at fault and he apportioned the blame equally between them pursuant to the provisions of the Negligence Act , R.S.B.C. 1979, c.204. The circumstances were that on March 16, 1987 the plaintiff, who was then 13 years of age, was riding his bicycle to school along Willemar Avenue in Courtenay. He was proceeding in a westerly direction. The defendant was driving his truck proceeding east along Willemar Avenue. The time was approximately 7:55 a.m., the plaintiff was proceeding to school and the defendant was proceeding to work. As the plaintiff approached the intersection of Willemar Avenue and 17th Street, he was just behind and to the right of a car that was also travelling west along Willemar at about the same speed as the infant was proceeding on his bicycle. The intersection of Willemar and 17th is a T-intersection, 17 Street proceeds north from Willemar from that point. There is a school in the vicinity of the intersection, bus stops for school busses to let pupils on and off the vehicles, there were signs indicating a school zone. The defendant let the westbound vehicle adjacent to which the plaintiff was travelling proceed through the intersection. He slowed to permit that but did not come to a stop and after the vehicle had passed him he commenced to make a left hand turn, cutting the corner to some degree, and came into collision with plaintiff in the crosswalk on the north side of the intersection. The plaintiff, as he approached the corner of the intersection, rode between a hydro pole and the curb over a bump in the asphalt. He jumped his bicycle on this bump and landed in the cross-walk. He did not see the defendant's vehicle until it was one or two feet away. The collision took place between the bicycle and the truck at the right front of the truck near the headlight and in the area of the cross-walk which was in the north bound portion of 17th Street. The defendant did not see the plaintiff until immediately before the impact. The trial judge held the defendant to be at fault for failing to keep a proper look-out. There was no excessive speed on the part of the defendant. He was proceeding at a speed of 20 kilometres or probably less than that at the point of impact. The defendant does not appeal from the decision of the trial judge that he was negligent in failing to keep a proper look-out, however, the plaintiff appeals upon the basis that the trial judge erred in finding that he was contributorily negligent. It is clear that the plaintiff was not looking ahead at the intersection as he took the path between the telephone pole and the curb and jumped the asphalt bump that was situate there. He did not see the defendant's vehicle turning in the intersection until it was a foot or two away, too late for him to avoid it. He contends that he had the right of way at that point and that therefore, he was entitled to exercise that right of way over the defendant and that in those circumstances the trial judge erred in finding that he was also at fault. The trial judge said this: The plaintiff was riding his bicycle across a crosswalk in violation of S.185(2)(a.1) of the Motor Vehicle Act. He was not keeping a look out for vehicles coming off Willemar Road and directed his attention to the bump and a successful jump. I find that his negligence contributed to the cause of the accident. He was well aware of the dangers of riding his bicycle in that way and so must accept the consequences. In my opinion, it is of significance that the accident took place when the plaintiff was in the crosswalk. The section to which the trial judge referred provides: (a.1) shall not, for the purpose of crossing a highway, ride on a crosswalk unless authorized to do so by a bylaw made under section 120 or unless otherwise directed by a sign; There was no sign and no bylaw in the present case. In those circumstances, in my opinion, the plaintiff was not entitled to rely on the fact that he had the right of way. He would have had the right of way had he still been on the roadway but he was in the crosswalk, a place where he was prohibited from proceeding on his bicycle. In that location, he did not have the right of way upon which he relies and therefore, this is really not a case of the defendant being in a servient position and the plaintiff being able to rely on that fact in contending that he should not also be held to be at fault. If he did not have the right of way, then in my opinion, the trial judge arrived at the correct conclusion when he found that his breach of that provision in the Motor Vehicle Act , R.S.B.C. 1979, c.288, deprived him of his claim of right of way and resulted in his being partly at fault for this collision. The plaintiff has contended that nothing he did was causative of the accident. It seems to me in placing himself in that position in relation to the defendant's truck he contributed to the accident. For those reasons I would dismiss the appeal. HUTCHEON, J.A.: I agree. LEGG, J.A.: I agree. HINKSON, J.A.: The appeal is dismissed. E.E.H. J.A.",

        "text": " Date of Release: January 8th, l991 No. B880072 Vancouver Registry IN THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA BETWEEN: REASONS FOR JUDGMENT ) DOMINGOS DA ASSUNCAO ) ) OF THE HONOURABLE ) ) PLAINTIFF ) ) MR. JUSTICE DAVIES ) A N D: ) ) DONALD ROY and ) INSURANCE CORPORATION ) OF BRITISH COLUMBIA ) Ellen Bond, Esq. Counsel for the Plaintiff John P. Lauener, Esq. Counsel for the Defendants The plaintiff claims damages for injuries arising out of a motor vehicle accident that occurred January l5th, l986. The defendants have offered no defence to the evidence led by the Plaintiff clearly indicating negligence on the part of the driver of the motor vehicle owned by the defendant, Roy. I therefore find responsibility for the accident on the defendant, Donald Roy. The plaintiff had stopped at an intersection when his vehicle was hit on the front left quadrant by the defendant's vehicle which was turning. The defendant's vehicle then spun around and struck the plaintiff's vehicle a second time. It then struck another car before leaving the scene of the accident. - 2 - The plaintiff's head hit the roof of his vehicle as a result of the initial impact. He was taken by ambulance to the Burnaby General Hospital. There he was treated in the Emergency Department, and released later the same day. He saw his family doctor, Dr. Herbert Lee, the following day. At that time he was complaining of dizziness, headaches, pain in his left chest, pain in his neck with restricted movement and noises in his ears which he described as \"birdlike.\" His headaches decreased over the next few weeks, however, the pain in his neck became worse and he was referred to Dr. I. Tsang, a Rheumatologist. In a report dated February 2nd, l988, Dr. Tsang reported as follows: \"After his first visit with me my impression was that he sustained a soft tissue injury to his neck area and the left interior chest wall from the accident. I think that he was then on his way to recovery which will be enhanced by pysiotherapy. I sent him to the Pysiotherapy Department at Shaughnessy Hospital for treatment and I subsequently saw him March l3th and April 28th, l986. During those visits, he reported continued improvement with his neck pain and the shoulder movement. The chest pain was improving as well. I encouraged him to continue on with the pysiotherapy and indicated to him that it was important to do his - 3 - exercises at home. I did not see him again until December 7th, l987. At that visit he informed me that since his last visit with me in April l986, he continued to have discomfort in his neck and the discomfort was worsened with changes in the weather. He was suffering from dizzy spells with movement of his neck as well. The dizziness was described as a sensation of light headedness, but at times there was true vertigo........................ Because of the ongoing neck symptoms an X-ray of his cervical spine was done and the X-rays showed radiological evidence of boney ankylosis compatible with DISH SYNDROME. The movement of his cervical spine had deteriorated since his physiotherapy and when I saw him again on December 4th, l987, he had about fifty percent decrease in range of motion of the cervical spine in all directions............................................... \"DISH SYNDROME\" is a medical condition of unknown etiology. The patient who suffers from Dish Syndrome develops excessive osteophyte formation along their vertebral column resulting in decreased range of motion of the affected area. They also tend to develop - 4 - excessive calcification of the tendons and ligaments and site of the attachment again resulting in deceased range of motion. This is an ongoing chronic condition and I believe in Mr. Da Assuncao the condition pre-existed his automobile accident and I do not believe the accident has affected the progress of his condition in any particular way. However, because of the accident and the decreased physical activity resulting from the aches and pains caused by the accident, it may result in further reduction of range of motion of his vertebral column and extremities and this is probably why the condition has become clinically more apparent since the accident.\" Mr. Da Assuncao continued to complain of dizziness and as a result, Dr. Lee referred him to Dr. C. Man, an Otolaryngologist. Dr. Man tested the plaintiff's hearing and found symmetrical hearing loss which he did not attribute to the accident. However, he did find evidence of damage to the vestibular system. In March of l987, the plaintiff was examined by Dr. Patricia R. Emmons, a Neurologist. Dr. Emmons reported in part as follows: \"It is my impression this man had a head injury when he was involved in the motor vehicle accident of January - 5 - l5th, l986, when his head hit the roof of the car and the side of the car and with the accident, he had an upset of the vestibular apparatus and his hearing. He has been followed by Dr. Man and he has had some gradual improvement in his ability to walk, but he has not yet been able to return to work because he cannot hear well enough and because he gets recruitment when he does hear more than one person speaking at a time. He cannot drive because if he moves his head to turn and look to one side or the other, he gets dizzy and off balance and this again inhibits him from doing his work.\" DIAGNOSIS: \"Vertigo of central etiology associated with injury to the labyrinth on the left causing difficulty in moving and walking and also associated decreased hearing. Neck soft tissue injury as a result of the sudden jarring associated with the accident.\" Mr. Da Assuncao was seen by yet another Neurologist, Dr. Jeff H. Beckman, in August of l987. Dr. Beckman took a history from the plaintiff and then examined him. The following is the comment given in his report of August l4th, l987: - 6 - \"Mr. Da Assuncao complains of mild residual signs of positional vertigo. It sounds as if he did have mild post traumatic vertigo after his accident which appears to be improving. He does complain of a hearing loss and although objectively he appears to have one, I would be interested to see what the Audiometry Report is on him. As far as his neck spasm goes, this appears to be minimal at this point in time. My suspicion is he tends to exaggarate it a bit and overall I assured him that this should continue to improve. I encouraged him to try and return to work and that he should attempt to practice driving in an empty parking lot on the weekend to see if he is able to be comfortable behind the wheel.\" Mr. Da Assuncao testified that his dizziness made him nervous about driving his automobile and the \"birdlike noises\" in his ears badly hampered his ability to communicate effectively. He stated that the dizziness improved only gradually and did not completely disappear until August of l989. He still complains of \"birdlike noises\" in his ears which he says interfere with his ability to hear. His headaches which followed the accident lasted for perhaps two months and the pain in his chest for six months. He has restricted neck movement, but this is not due to the accident. In summary, Mr. Da Assuncao, sufferred a blow to his head and - 7 - a whiplash type injury in the accident of January l5th, l986. His injuries resulted in headaches, pain and restricted movement in his neck, chest pain, dizziness and noises in his ears. The soft tissue injury to his neck and chest subsided in a matter of months, however, the dizziness and problem with his ears persisted. I believe that Mr. Da Assuncao's recovery was impeded because of depression caused by the accident. However, I do not believe that his injuries or his depression were as severe or lasted as long as he suggested. His recovery from these injuries was complicated by another motor vehicle accident in which he was involved January 8th, l989. At that time, he rear-ended another car and although he sufferred no physical injuries he was apparently shaken up sufficiently to be hospitalized for two days. On giving evidence, he complained of a loss of hearing. However, there is no medical evidence to indicate that his loss of hearing was a result of the accident. Indeed, I noted during the course of the trial that on occasions his hearing improved markedly when he became aggitated. In any event, he has now recovered from all of his injuries with the exception of the occasional ringing sound in his ears which is not impairing him in his occupation as a Real Estate Salesman. I affix his non-pecuniary damages at $l7,500.00. As I have mentioned, the plaintiff was employed as a Real Estate Salesman at the time of the accident. He was qualified as a Real Estate Salesman in l971 and has worked for a number of Real - 8 - Estate Companies in Vancouver. In or about l977 he commenced working with Stella Lee in a form of partnership. They found that they worked very effectively as a team with Mr. Da Assuncao obtaining most of the listings and Mrs. Lee being the specialist in selling. Much evidence was presented with respect to the plaintiff's earnings and Mrs. Lee's earnings in the years preceding the accident. The argument was made by the defendants that I should average the plaintiff's monthly income for two years prior to the motor vehicle accident and then calculate his earnings on that basis. I don't consider that to be a fair approach. A Real Estate Salesman's income will vary with the demand for real estate. In this case, I have the plaintiff's partner's income for the years following the accident as a guide. They had worked together for a number of years and split commissions earned except on rare occasions where one might have done all of the effective work on a particular sale. After reviewing the theories suggested for calculating loss of income, I have concluded that the appropriate approach is that suggested by the plaintiff which incorporates the calculations of Mr. John Struthers, a Consulting Economist, who was called by the plaintiff. Having concluded that the plaintiff should have been capable of returning to work full time in January l989 and using Mr. Struthers' figures giving the projected net income loss for the years l986, l987 and l988, I have determined - 9 - the plaintiff's loss of earnings as follows: 1986: $10,800.00 1987: $15,573.00 1988: $30,517.00 ___________ Total: $56,890.00 =========== However, because of the various contingencies in life which could well have affected the plaintiff's ability to earn income over the period I have found to be his period of loss, I have settled upon the figure of $45,000.00 as being a realistic figure for lost income. Therefore, the plaintiff is entitled to judgment as follows: Non-pecuniary damages: $l7,500.00 Loss of income: $45,000.00 Special damages: 69.82 - 10 - The plaintiff is also entitled to his costs and Court Order interest at the rates from time to time prescribed by the Registrar of this Honourable Court.

Date: 20000104 2000 BCSC 4 Docket: 4342/96 Registry: Victoria IN THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA IN THE MATTER OF THE BUILDERS LIEN ACT, R.S.B.C. 1979, CHAPTER 40 AND AMENDMENTS THERETO BETWEEN: ALLIANCE ENGINEERING WORKS (1985) LTD. AND DAVID LARSEN PLAINTIFFS AND: JCR CONSTRUCTION LTD., THE CORPORATION OF THE DISTRICT OF SAANICH, THE BOARD OF SCHOOL TRUSTEES OF SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 61 (GREATER VICTORIA) AND AXA PACIFIC INSURANCE COMPANY DEFENDANTS RULING OF THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE R. D. WILSON Counsel for the plaintiff David Larsen D. Ashton Counsel for the defendants JCR Construction Ltd. and Axa Pacific Insurance Company H. J. Rusk Date and Place of Hearing/Trial: 15 December 1999 Victoria, BC [1] The defendants JCR and Axa apply to dismiss the claim of the plaintiff David Larsen, for want of prosecution. [2] I was not satisfied that in all of the circumstances of this case a dismissal was warranted. Reasons were to follow. These are those reasons. [3] This lawsuit originated in a construction project. The defendant JCR was the general contractor on that project. JCR let a sub-contract to H.T.D. Custom Woodworking Ltd., for the supply and installation of millwork, for the project. [4] Discussions between the general and its sub-trade to that end occurred in late 1994. [5] On 22 November 1994 the general sent to the sub-trade a proposed form of sub-contract agreement. Among other things, that sub-contract agreement anticipated a schedule, starting June 1995, and completing no later than 28 October 1995. That did not happen. The millwork segment of the project commenced in early 1996. Substantial completion of the project was certified on 12 September 1996. [6] On 19 September 1996, H.T.D. filed a claim of builder's lien against the title to the project. This action, to enforce that claim of lien, was initiated 11 December 1996. A notice of trial was taken out on 10 November 1997, fixing 12 April 1999 as the date for commencement of the trial. [7] On 3 December 1997, H.T.D. made an assignment into bankruptcy. [8] On 2 March 1998, JCR made an application for an order dismissing the H.T.D. action, on the ground, among others, that H.T.D. had failed to respond to interrogatories. JCR's application was adjourned generally, on 28 April 1998, on the condition that JCR would receive responses to its interrogatories. And on the further condition that the status of the parties to this litigation be clarified given H.T.D.'s status as a bankrupt. [9] JCR renewed it application for an order dismissing the action on 10 February 1999. On the hearing of that application, the court declined to grant the relief, but did order that the present plaintiff, Mr. Larsen, make application to be joined as a party in the place of the plaintiff H.T.D. [10] The reorganizing of the parties to this litigation was made possible by the giving, by H.T.D., on 14 August 1995, of a general assignment of its book debts to the Bank of Nova Scotia. As it developed, neither the Bank of Nova Scotia nor the trustee in bankruptcy pursued the claims made by H.T.D. in this action. However, the Bank of Nova Scotia did agree to assign its assignment to Mr. Larsen. [11] Upon the necessary documentation being executed by the Bank of Nova Scotia, Mr. Larsen, on application, received an order on 10 March 1999 that he be substituted for H.T.D. as plaintiff in this action. [12] The parties were not ready to proceed to trial, as scheduled, in April 1999. [13] JCR renewed its application for an order dismissing the action on 1 June 1999. JCR agreed to an adjournment of that application on the condition that a trial date would be set, and that Mr. Larsen would file and deliver an amended statement of claim. [14] On 22 June 1999, the matter was called but did not proceed. [15] The trial did commence on 5 July 1999. The plaintiff led his evidence during that week. At the close of the plaintiff's case the defendants JCR and Axa made a \"no evidence\" motion. That motion was dismissed. [16] I then raised concerns I had about the state of the pleadings, the absence of the trustee in bankruptcy, and the status of the defendants' counterclaim in the face of the Builders Lien Act and the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act . [17] On 23 July 1999, I heard an application, which I instigated over Mr. Larsen's objection, to add the trustee as a party to this litigation. After hearing from the trustee, I dismissed the application. There remained the plaintiff's application for an order that he have leave to amend his statement of claim. That application not having been brought on by early September 1999, JCR renewed its application to dismiss this action for want of prosecution on 10 September 1999. I was not able to hear that application until 15 December 1999 by reason of scheduling and availability. [18] The applicable principles for the implementation of the relief prescribed in R. 2(7) are not difficult to state. The first step is to ask and answer three questions. First, has the delay been inordinate? Second, if inordinate, then is it excusable? And third, is there likely to be prejudice from the delay? [19] The trial was initially scheduled to commence in April 1999. The trial did commence in July 1999. It will not finish in 1999. I am told, however, that it may conclude in March 2000. The delay to be considered, therefor, is from July 1999 to March 2000. The delay is troublesome. But, in comparison to the circumstances in a number of authorities which have attracted the remedy, not inordinate. [20] The explanation given by the plaintiff for the delay is twofold. First, counsel's misunderstanding of the scheduling procedures in this registry and second, the availability of court time. [21] If I am wrong in concluding that the delay is not \"inordinate\", then I am satisfied that the delay is excusable. [22] If I am wrong on both of those principles, then it seems to me that the prejudice which must attract concern, is the prejudice to a fair trial. [23] I am not satisfied that the delay will prejudice a fair trial for the defendant. The plaintiff's evidence has been led and cross-examined by counsel for the defendants JCR and Axa. If this matter is to continue, then the continuation will deal with the evidence of the defendant JCR on its counterclaim. [24] Hence, the application to dismiss for want of prosecution was dismissed. Costs of that application will be in the cause. \"R. D. Wilson, J.\" The Honourable Mr. Justice R. D. Wilson",

Sissons Counsel for the Plaintiff and Defendant, Welk R.A. Skolrood Counsel for the Defendants, Mantelli and Black Top Cabs Ltd. P. Hansen Counsel for the Plaintiff, Alcombrack Heard at Vancouver: January 4, 5 and 6, 1993 As a result of a motor vehicle accident which occurred on September 3, 1988 at Vancouver, British Columbia, four actions were commenced which were ordered to be heard at the same time as to liability only, subject to the direction of the trial judge. The trial proceeded in accordance with such orders. The accident occurred at about 3:30 a.m. on September 3, 1988 at the intersection of Main Street and Prior Street in the City of Vancouver when a 1968 Mustang motor vehicle owned and driven by Brian David Welk in a northerly direction on Main Street, in which vehicle Tamara Lynn Wahl, Wendy Sue Claggett and Ronald Schultz were riding as passengers, collided with a 1985 Pontiac motor vehicle owned by Black Top Cabs Ltd. being driven by Roberto Mantelli in an easterly direction on Prior Street, in which vehicle Karen Alcombrack was riding as a passenger. The two motor vehicles collided within the intersection. It was a clear, dry night. The intersection proper was well illuminated by artificial lighting. There is no evidence of excessive speed on the part of either driver. The intersection was controlled by multiple traffic control devices for the directions of travel on both streets. It is common ground the traffic control devices were functioning properly. The respective phases of the lights exhibited by the traffic control devices are documented and form part of the evidence at trial. While the plaintiff passengers in both vehicles in their respective actions named both drivers as defendants and alleged negligence on their part, at trial their evidence clearly was given to support the position of the driver of the vehicle in which they were riding as passengers. Welk and the passengers in his vehicle say that as the Welk vehicle approached and entered the intersection, the traffic control device was signalling green. Mantelli and the passenger in his vehicle say as the Mantelli vehicle approached and entered the intersection, the traffic control device was signalling green. In keeping with the proper function of the traffic control devices at the intersection, one of the drivers must have entered the intersection against the direction of the applicable traffic control device - against a red light. Apart from the drivers and passengers in the two vehicles, there were no witnesses to the accident. In addition to the evidence of the drivers and passengers in both vehicles there were filed in evidence at trial a number of photographs, diagrams, reports and the expert opinion of Craig Brown, P.Eng. who assessed the speed of the Welk vehicle at the material times. At the outset, I find that having regard to the circumstances existing here, the sole cause of this accident was the negligence of the driver who entered the intersection against the direction of the red light. In this regard, the relative times, distances, speeds and potential for the taking of evasive action are not such to support a finding of contributory negligence on the part of either driver. See Horseman v. McGarvey [1983] 3 W.W.R. at 564 . I have considered the evidence of the occupants of the two motor vehicles who gave evidence at trial. I am satisfied they collectively were attempting to describe what occurred as best as they could in the circumstances then existing. In this regard, I do not find any witness was attempting to enlarge upon or to exaggerate his or her evidence. When assessing their evidence, however, I find there arises a serious question as to the reliability of the evidence given by certain of the witnesses, particularly that of Karen Alcombrack and, in part, that of Roberto Mantelli. In giving her evidence, Karen Alcombrack was at times barely audible and appeared to be hesitant and uncertain. Most importantly, during the course of cross-examination, she agreed that at the material times she thought \"the sun was bright - it was a nice sunrise - it was beautiful\" and how she wished she had her sunglasses. It is common ground it was dark. The only illumination provided was by street lamps. Sunrise did not occur until 6:32 a.m. I consider it sufficient to say that I find Ms. Alcombrack was disoriented at the time and for that reason, I do not accept her evidence. Mr. Mantelli gave his evidence in a manner which suggested either he was indifferent to the seriousness of the matter or he had difficulty remembering with any sense of accuracy what occurred. For example, he thought the accident occurred on a Monday (as opposed to Saturday); initially that it occurred in the evening (as opposed to 3:30 a.m. in the early morning); and that after the collision occurred, his vehicle came to rest straddling a crosswalk (as opposed to some considerable distance outside the perimeter of the intersection). I mention in passing that with regard to the location of the two vehicles after impact I accept where the investigating police officers positioned the vehicles as indicated in a sketch prepared by them. I have no such concerns with the evidence of Mr. Welk and the passengers in his vehicle as to what is material. They say that as the Welk vehicle approached and entered the intersection the traffic control device at the intersection was exhibiting a green light. The attack upon the credibility of the occupants of the Welk vehicle ranges from the fact of their close relationship as friends to their inability to recall with accuracy and precision what transpired during the late evening of September 2, 1988 when they arrived in Vancouver from Munroe, Washington until shortly before the accident. In my view, they gave a reasonable account of their movements in a City not familiar to them. Some time before the accident occurred, they had jointly decided to return to Washington rather than staying the remainder of the day in the Vancouver area. For this reason as they proceeded in a northerly direction on Main Street, Mr. Welk and the passengers in his vehicle were looking to return to a freeway which would take them out of the City. I find they had a reason to look for and to observe the traffic control device in question and any signage which would assist them in their return to Washington. They were not driving around aimlessly or otherwise but rather with the purpose I have described. In my view, the passengers in the Welk vehicle and Mr. Welk gave their evidence in a straightforward consistent manner as to what is material - what occurred as the Welk vehicle approached and entered the intersection, including the color being exhibited by the traffic control device. For these reasons I prefer the evidence of the occupants of the Welk vehicle. I find the collision was caused solely by the negligence of the defendant Roberto Mantelli, who at the time was acting in the course and scope of his employment with the defendant Black Top Cabs Ltd, in entering the intersection against a red light. In keeping with the findings I have made with regard to credibility, it is not necessary to consider the submissions if counsel related to the principles of law found in Wotta et al v. Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Co. Ltd. et al [1955] 2 D.L.R. 785 and the other authorities referred to in argument. The question of costs was not addressed by counsel. If counsel cannot reach agreement with regard to this question, it can be addressed either by memorandum or attending before me at a mutually convenient time. \"R.B. HARVEY, J.\" January 12, 1993 Vancouver, B.C.",

PLAINTIFF (APPELLANT) AND: MONTREAL TRUST COMPANY OF CANADA DEFENDANT (RESPONDENT) Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice Hutcheon The Honourable Mr. Justice Legg The Honourable Mr. Justice Finch M. P.O'Neill Counsel for the Appellant J. F. Grieve Counsel for the Respondent Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British Columbia January 21, 1994 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia February 1, 1994 Written Reasons by : The Honourable Mr. Justice Hutcheon Concurred in by : The Honourable Mr. Justice Legg The Honourable Mr. Justice Finch No. CA016690 Vancouver Registry Court of Appeal for British Columbia 233467 B.C. Ltd. v. Montreal Trust Company of Canada REASONS FOR JUDGMENT OF THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE HUTCHEON 1. At the end of the hearing of the appeal we dismissed the appeal with written reasons to follow. These are those reasons. 2. In January 1985 the appellant, 233467 B.C. Ltd., borrowed money from the respondent, Montreal Trust Company of Canada Ltd., and as security for the loan of $614,000 granted a mortgage to Montreal Trust to mature in five years. At the end of the five year period, Montreal Trust, in February 1990, extended the mortgage for a further period of four years. In the extension agreement, the borrower did not have the right to prepay the principal. The issue in this appeal is whether during the term of the extension the borrower could compel Montreal Trust to grant a discharge of the mortgage upon payment of the principal and three months interest. 3. The borrower claimed the right to do this under s.10(1) of the Interest Act but Mr. Justice Collver held that the section did not apply, firstly, because the borrower was a corporation and secondly, because the term of the mortgage had not exceeded five years. Section 10(1) cannot be invoked \"until a time more than five years after the date of the mortgage\" and, by section 10(2), the section does not apply \"to any mortgage upon real estate given by a joint stock company.\" 4. Briefly stated, the facts are that in 1992 the borrower had arranged to sell its condominium project and needed clear title to complete the sale. Montreal Trust advised that it would accept prepayment of principal and grant a discharge of the mortgage on receipt of the principal then owing plus $55,000. By letter dated June 26, 1992, the borrower insisted that under s.10(1) of the Interest Act it was entitled to a discharge upon the payment of the principal plus three months interest, or approximately $18,000. It was prepared to pay a bit more than $18,000 as a matter of goodwill. Montreal Trust did not agree. 5. On 3 July 1992 the borrower caused to be deposited $594,352.58, that is the principal, plus three months interest and miscellaneous charges, in the appropriate account at Montreal Trust. When Montreal Trust refused to deliver a discharge of the mortgage, the borrower, on 28 July 1992, filed a petition in the Supreme Court for a declaration that the mortgage had been paid off and discharged. On the first hearing of the petition on 27 August 1992, the judge ordered that upon payment by the borrower of $42,000 into the trust account of the solicitors for Montreal Trust the mortgage be discharged. He further ordered that written argument be filed to determine the entitlement to the $42,000. The borrower made the payment and the mortgage was discharged. The Interest Act s.10 (1) Whenever any principal money or interest secured by mortgage on real property is not, under the terms of the mortgage, payable until a time more than five years after the date of the mortgage, then, if at any time after the expiration of the five years, any person liable to pay or entitled to redeem the mortgage tenders or pays, to the person entitled to receive the money, the amount due for principal money and interest to the time of payment, as calculated under sections 6 to 9, together with three months further interest in lieu of notice, no further interest shall be chargeable, payable or recoverable at any time thereafter on the principal money or interest due under the mortgage. (2) Nothing in this section applies to any mortgage on real property given by a joint stock company or other corporation, nor to any debenture issued by any such company or corporation, for the payment of which security has been given by way of mortgage on real property, R.S., c.I-18 , s.10. 6. The judge held that the mortgage remained one given by a corporation and thus subject to s.10(2) notwithstanding the involvement of the principals of the company as covenantors. He also held that by reason of the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Potash v. Royal Trust , [1986] 6 W.W.R. 550 (S.C.C.), s.10(1) is intended to permit the mortgagor to pay the mortgage off at the end of each five-year renewal period. Thus even though the mortgage was in its eighth year, the renewal period was only in its third year. 7. For the reasons given by the chambers judge I agree that s.10(1) of the Interest Act has no application to the facts of this case. The Position On Appeal 8. Mr. O'Neill, counsel for the appellant on the appeal, sought to persuade us that Montreal Trust had no right to elect to retain the payment of principal and interest and then to demand additional moneys. He also submitted in the alternative that it would be unjust enrichment if Montreal Trust recovered a return on investment greater than the interest revenue contemplated by the mortgage. 9. The first submission overlooks the course of the proceedings initiated and followed by the borrower. The second fails to take account of the legal position of Montreal Trust confirmed by the chambers judge. 10. The legal position was that, because s.10(1) of the Interest Act did not apply, Montreal Trust was entitled to require the borrower to comply with the terms of the mortgage for the balance of the four year extension period. No law was available to compel Montreal Trust to terminate its contract with the borrower at an earlier date. The chambers judge found that the amount demanded by Montreal Trust to do so was simply the price fixed to vary the extension agreement. 11. I think that to be exactly right. Further, the borrower was not compelled by any law to pay that price and it did so for its own benefit to complete the sale of the project. 12. To obtain a discharge of the mortgage the borrower filed a petition in the Supreme Court for a remedy under s.10(1) of the Interest Act . No one has mentioned that s.10(1) does not provide for the remedy of a discharge of the mortgage. It may be that such a remedy is beyond the legislative competence of the Parliament of Canada. Whatever the explanation, s.10(1) has no reference to a discharge of the mortgage or to the state of the title after payment. 13. In filing the petition the borrower was not seeking the return of its money; its objective was the discharge of the mortgage essential to the completion of the sale. When the judge made the order on 27 August 1992, the borrower followed the course proposed by the judge to achieve that end by making the payment of $42,000. It could have decided not to make the payment and called for the repayment of the principal. Having elected to initiate and follow the course of proceedings that it did, the borrower cannot complain that Montreal Trust, although not legally obliged to do so, agreed to participate on the terms set out in the order. These are the reasons that caused us to dismiss the appeal. \"The Honourable Mr. Justice Hutcheon\" I agree: \"The Honourable Mr. Justice Legg\" I agree: \"The Honourable Mr. Justice Finch\"",

        "text": "Date of Release: January 4, 1993 No. 5939/24170 Victoria Registry IN THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA BETWEEN: ) ) CHERIE ELIZABETH FORBES ) REASONS FOR JUDGMENT ) PETITIONER ) ) OF THE HONOURABLE AND: ) ) DAVID NEAL FORBES ) MADAM JUSTICE HUDDART ) RESPONDENT ) W. Murphy-Dyson Counsel for the Petitioner R.C. Doell Counsel for the Respondent Heard at Victoria December 16-18, l992 This divorce proceeding was really about a difference in the views of parents about the appropriate future care arrangements for their 18-year old autistic son, Kerry. They agree about most other matters, particularly that the family assets should be divided equally. The older daughter, Candace, who turned 19 in October, hopes to obtain her Grade 12 certificate and then to follow studies with a view to becoming a dental hygienist or assistant. She is living with Mrs. Forbes. Her parents agree that she should have this opportunity and both are ready to provide a home free of charge for her. The marriage has been over for more than a year and on the opening day of the trial I made a divorce order reflecting that fact. At the conclusion of the trial I made orders about which there was no disagreement and others which I considered followed unquestionably from the evidence. Thus, I ordered that Mrs. Forbes have sole custody of Kerry, exclusive possession of the family residence pending these reasons, ownership of the contents of that residence except for Mr. Forbes' tools, and ownership of the 1974 Volvo in her possession. Mr. Forbes was to have ownership of the chattels in his possession and of the tools remaining in the family residence which he removes within 2 weeks at his expense; he was to transfer the 1974 Volvo to Mrs. Forbes forthwith; he was to remove the 1968 Volvo stored in a neighbour's carport forthwith; he was to arrange for the listing and valuation of the chattels in the possession of both himself and his wife at his expense; he was to name his wife as the irrevocable beneficiary of his Seaboard Life Insurance Company number 3063704, to maintain that policy in good standing, and to authorize that company to disclose from time to time to Mrs. Forbes such information as she might request; and he was to continue to pay maintenance on the terms of the interim order pending these reasons. Sufficient monies from those held in trust by the parties' solicitors were to be paid to Mrs. Forbes to permit her to purchase and install a new gas furnace in accord with the estimate produced at the trial. Those orders left for consideration the issue of joint guardianship of and access to Kerry, the terms on which Mrs. Forbes will retain possession of the family residence, the division of Mr. Forbes' pensions, and maintenance for Mrs. Forbes and Kerry. Guardianship of Kerry Forbes The resolution of these issues requires a consideration of Kerry's condition. Kerry will become an adult on February 10, 1994, and begin to receive a disability pension on February 20, 1993, when he turns 18. From my reading of the G.A.I.N. legislation, he is likely to receive about $740.00 per month, although the shelter portion of $325 is variable depending on need. That income will greatly assist his parents, but it will not make Kerry independent of them. He will remain a child of the marriage for the parents' lifetimes unless he earlier withdraws to the complete care of the government in a government-sponsored residence. He will require a guardian of both his person and his estate until he is 19. When he becomes an adult he will require a committee of both his person and his estate. Both his parents accept that reality and are willing to accept those roles. They disagree only on whether he should live with his mother for so long as she is able and willing to care for him, or whether he should live in a government-funded group home for autistic adults after a suitable transition period. While the government provides funding at a cost in excess of $100,000 per year for an autistic adult who lives in a group home, it provides little assistance for such an adult for whom one or both parents is willing to care at home. Mrs. Forbes is receiving the maximum assistance to which she and Mr. Forbes are entitled today. Were Mr. Forbes unable to contribute to the maintenance of Mrs. Forbes, she would probably choose to live on social assistance so as to stay at home to care for Kerry. It is anticipated that Kerry will either begin school in January or attend an adult day programme such as those that are attended by residents of group homes. If and when such a school or programme is found for Kerry, Mrs. Forbes could seek employment during hours when Kerry is away from home, but would need to be available to answer Kerry's needs if for any reason the programme failed them. Kerry has an estimated mental age of 3 - 4 years, and suffers from a seizure disorder and an allergy tension fatigue syndrome. He requires care 24 hours per day from someone skilled at working with autistic youth. He weighs 82 kilos and has a height of 168 centimetres. He has very little verbal speech but can make himself understood by those who care for him, including his parents and his sister. He is generally co-operative, gentle, and slow-moving. Both parents consider him a loving child. He is also subject to tantrums which the parents have learned to limit by careful behaviour modification and to control with the use of a time-out room. Until October 1991 he attended school regularly. When the programme at Reynolds no longer met his needs Mrs. Forbes withdrew him from it, without consulting Mr. Forbes, although he has had joint custody of Kerry since the separation. Since that time Mrs. Forbes has cared for Kerry on a full-time basis with the assistance of a child-care worker for 20 hours per week and of respite care funded by the Department of Health and provided by Candace at an average cost of $200 per month. Over the years Mr. and Mrs. Forbes have been committed to providing care at home for Kerry. He is considerably more functional than most autistic children in Victoria and they did not want him to regress by being among those significantly more handicapped than himself. Mrs. Forbes has been the primary care-giver, the one who worked most continually and extensively with him. Meanwhile Mr. Forbes has worked hard as a journeyman millwright to provide the economic stability and income the family needed. Until recently he has worked the considerable over-time available to him at the Crofton Pulp and Paper Division of Fletcher Challenge Canada where his base monthly income is $4000. The roles the parents adopted during the marriage have fixed their relationship with Kerry. For that reason I granted sole custody to Mrs. Forbes at the conclusion of the trial. There should be no arguments about Kerry's day to day while he is living with Mrs. Forbes. She should have full authority to care for him as she thinks best without the interference of Mr. Forbes. However, because Kerry is totally dependent on his parents for his care, I consider that until he turns 19, Mr. Forbes should share the guardianship duties with Mrs. Forbes. Mr. Forbes has always been the economic provider for Kerry. He will continue to be the major source of funds for his care. It is in Kerry's interest to have the person primarily responsible for him economically have some legal means of influencing the major decisions as to his care arrangements. Mr. Forbes should also be in a position to take over immediately the care of Kerry should Mrs. Forbes become unavailable to care for him. Moreover, Mr. Forbes has expressed an interest in attempting to get further government assistance for the care of Kerry while he continues to live at home. As a joint guardian he will be in a better position to pursue that interest. Meanwhile Mr. Forbes should have generous access to Kerry. He should exercise that access on a regular basis so that Mrs. Forbes can count on regular periods of free time for herself and Kerry can be prepared for the visit. That access should include a regular period of time on alternate Sundays and one evening each week and such other times as Mr. Forbes may request on 24 hours' notice to Mrs. Forbes. If Mr. Forbes is unwilling to accept access as not only a right but a responsibility then I will reconsider my order regarding joint guardianship. Mrs. Forbes has liberty to apply for that change to me until Kerry becomes an adult. The Family Residence It is clear that Mrs. Forbes and Kerry need to continue to reside indefinitely in the family residence. Although fathers of two more severely handicapped autistic adults testified as to the alternative residential arrangements they had been able to make for their adult sons, and counsel speculated on what might become available for Kerry if Mr. and Mrs. Forbes begin now to work toward an alternative residential arrangement, there was no evidence that such a facility can be put in place within any foreseeable period of time. The Ministry of Social Services reacts to need and pressure. Currently, Kerry is being well cared for by his parents with the help of his sister and a child-care worker. If both parents were to desert Kerry he would be placed in a special foster-care home. Mr. Forbes is in full agreement that Kerry and his mother must remain in the family residence for a transition period that could be as much as 10 years, but he considers that some time limit should be placed on the exclusive occupancy order so that Mrs. Forbes will be required to co-operate with the project of finding a suitable permanent home for Kerry among other similarly afflicted adults where he can live after he and Mrs. Forbes have lost the capacity to care for him or die. He wants the transition to be made during their lifetimes. Mrs. Forbes has not accepted that she must face that decision. For the moment she feels young, healthy, and quite capable of caring for him indefinitely. She has grown to accept and like what she considers her job. She gets great satisfaction from doing it well. She wants to be able to continue to care for Kerry indefinitely. While I sympathize with Mr. Forbes' desire to see some light at the end of the tunnel, I consider that I cannot gaze into the future with sufficient certainty to limit the period during which Mrs. Forbes will be entitled to exclusive possession of the family residence. If the parties cannot agree on the terms of that exclusive possession, they may address the issue in written memoranda. I am not prepared to vest the family residence in Mrs. Forbes. It is the family's only significant asset other than Mr. Forbes' two pensions and Registered Retirement Savings Plan. The Pension Plans As at December 31, 1990 the R.R.S.P. had a value of $13513.76. The Pulp and Paper Industry Pension Plan monthly pension benefit accrued as at June 30, 1991 was $548.35. This is the amount Mr. Forbes would receive as a deferred annuity from January 1, 2014, if he had terminated his employment on June 30, 1991. He is not entitled to a joint and last survivor option. Mr. Forbes agrees that Mrs. Forbes will receive a minimum of $274 monthly from that pension if and when he reaches that retirement date, for so long as he lives. The information provided to the court does not indicate that there are any benefits payable to his estate or to a survivor if he dies before that date. Because Mr. Forbes \"broke his service\" under the IWA-Forest Industry Pension Plan on December 31, 1986, this plan will provide a basic monthly retirement pension of $175 commencing at age 65 (2013). Because he has only 7 years of credited service under this plan he is not entitled to pre-retirement joint and survivor coverage. He is entitled to take a reduced pension after his 60th birthday. Mrs. Forbes is entitled to receive one-half of those annuity payments if and when they are received. Probably because of the expense involved in a valuation of these pension benefits, neither party led evidence as to their value. Nevertheless, Mrs. Forbes would like to give up her interest in them, obtain title to the family residence, and pay Mr. Forbes whatever is necessary to equalize the division of family assets out of the proceeds of sale if and when she sells the home. She considers there is no value to her in having a R.R.S.P. or a deferred annuity when it is likely that she will have to accept social assistance if Mr. Forbes becomes unwilling or unable to pay maintenance. In essence, Mrs. Forbes is asking the court to order Mr. Forbes to purchase her interest in these deferred annuities and the R.R.S.P. by giving her an increased interest in the family home. Quite apart from the lack of evidence as to value on which to base such an order, I am of the view that such an arrangement would be unreasonable. There is no question that the court may make such an order under Part 3 of the Family Relations Act against the wishes of the spouse whose only asset is contingent future income in the absence of a contract. Touwslager v Touwslager (1992), 63 B.C.L.R. (2d) 247 (C.A.). Section 52 (1) provides that jurisdiction to interfere with the property rights of the spouses in these words: 52. (1) In proceedings under this Part or on application, the Supreme Court may determine any matter respecting the ownership, right of possession or division of property under this Part, including the vesting of property under section 51, and may make orders which are necessary, reasonable or ancillary to give effect to the determination. In Touwslager the Court of Appeal considered that fairness required the vesting of the family residence in the wife and the pension in the husband. The court emphasized the difficulties the wife would be facing in enforcing the division of deferred benefits. With the enactment of the Pension Benefits Standards Act and the revision of Revenue Canada's policy with regard to the taxation of pension payments divided between spouses on marriage breakdown, these concerns have less force. In the circumstances of this case, I do not think the exchange of a future income stream contingent on survival to the age of 60 or 65 for a one-half interest in the family residence, should be forced on Mr. Forbes under section 52 because I do not think such an order is required to accomplish the equal division of the family's assets which the spouses have agreed is fair. Mrs. Forbes is entitled to one-half of the pension benefits if and when they are paid. She is at liberty to apply for such order as counsel deem advisable upon the coming into effect of the Pension Benefits Standards Act . Until such time as an order can be made requiring the plan administrator to divide the annuity payments equally between the parties or the plan administrator agrees to do so, Mr. Forbes will hold his interest in both plans in trust for Mrs. Forbes as to one-half the benefits accrued to December 18, 1992. Subject to what I have to say about the equalization of the division of the chattels, Mr. Forbes is also to transfer to her one-half of the balance in his R.R.S.P. account at the Toronto-Dominion Bank on the date of transfer pursuant to the provisions of the Income Tax Act permitting a tax-free roll-over between spouses on marriage breakdown. The Chattels The party who is keeping chattels having the greater value will pay to the other one-half of the difference. The payment may be made by way of adjustment in the portion of the R.R.S.P. to be transferred. Maintenance Mrs. Forbes presents a budget of $2020 for herself and Kerry which Mr. Forbes agrees is entirely reasonable. Incidentally, that budget allows Mrs. Forbes to provide a home for Candace at no additional cost. To net that income, Mrs. Forbes requires a gross income of $2250. Her only income is the family allowance of $35. She asks for maintenance of $2200. If Mr. Forbes were to pay that amount he would have $1274 left each month to support himself in his apartment in Victoria after paying income tax and other compulsory deductions, including life and disability insurance and union dues. After paying $125 per month for a car pool to travel to and from Crofton, he would be left with $1149 to spend. Mr. Forbes' expenses, including the cost of operating his car in Victoria, total $1843. This budget is somewhat more generous to Mr. Forbes in matters of personal spending than is the budget of Mrs. Forbes to her. It could be trimmed to about $1500 without too much sacrifice and with some sacrifices to about $1300. Mr. Forbes has potential additional income from over-time. In 1991 his actual monthly income averaged $5000. In 1992 his over-time has been considerably reduced, but has still been sufficient to have permitted him to earn about $44,000 while being off work more than usual for various reasons. When Kerry begins to receive his G.A.I.N. allowance after his 18th birthday, the situation will ease for his parents. He will not require maintenance because that income will produce sufficient funds for Mrs. Forbes to keep him at home. Mrs. Forbes' contribution will be that she will care for Kerry whenever he is not with his father or participating in a day programme and be available for him even then. Mr. Forbes' contribution will be the maintenance of Mrs. Forbes in the family residence, so that she can give the care Kerry needs. Mrs. Forbes will then require $1400 to supplement the income she will receive from Kerry. When the tax consequences are taken into account she will require $1700 monthly. The interim order provides for the payment of $830 bi-weekly. That amount is the equivalent of $1800 per month. I think that maintenance should continue at $800 bi-weekly for Mrs. Forbes. That is the equivalent of $1730 per month. It takes into account the disability pension Kerry will receive. For the remaining bi-weekly periods during which Kerry will not be able to contribute to his maintenance from a disability pension, Mr. Forbes should pay $175 for his maintenance. Those amounts should be paid directly by Fletcher Challenge Canada as they are now. I note from the pay slips that Mr. Forbes' income is being deposited to his account at the Island Savings Credit Union in Duncan. It may be that counsel can make arrangements with Fletcher Challenge Canada on which their clients can agree that will be administratively simpler for the employer than the existing system and avoid the uncertainty as to the dates each month when the monies will be received by Mrs. Forbes. Because I have divided all the family property and the family income equally, I will not make any order as to costs in this matter unless I am advised that counsel wish to make submissions based on a formal offer to settle. They may do so in writing or by a telephone conference call in order to minimize further costs. \"C.M. HUDDART, J.\" December 31, 1992 Vancouver, B.C.",

        "text": " No.C896192 Vancouver Registry IN THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA BETWEEN: ) ) NORRY LYNN FITZPATRICK ) REASONS FOR JUDGMENT PETITIONER ) ) OF THE HONOURABLE AND: ) ) OTTMANN PROPERTIES LTD. ) MR. JUSTICE DONALD ) RESPONDENT ) Date and Place December 19, 1989 of Hearing: Vancouver, B.C. Counsel for the Petitioner: Dennis K. Fitzpatrick Counsel for the Respondent: Andrew Davis The petitioner seeks an order relieving her of a building height restriction imposed by the respondent pursuant to a covenant within a building scheme known as The MacDonald Creek Subdivision in West Vancouver. The petition is filed pursuant to s.31 of the Property Law Act , s.216 of the Land Title Act and Rule 10 of the Rules of Court. The dispute arose when the petitioner submitted house plans to the respondent and the respondent gave building approval conditional on a reduction of the roof height by about three feet. The respondent owns the land on the slope immediately above the petitioner's property. The roof height proposed by the petitioner would partially obstruct the view of some of the condominiums the respondent is developing on the lot above. The condominimum development is not part of the building scheme. The Contract of Purchase and Sale of the petitioner's property provided that the sale was subject to Statutory Building Scheme No. CB58841 and provided further: The purchase acknowledges and agrees as follows: 1. prior to commencement of construction all building plans shall be submitted in triplicate to the Vendor for approval; 2. any dwelling erected on the property is subject to all Municipal By-laws including Development Permit No. 84-18 3. Purchaser will not object to Vendor's development of the 11-unit condominium development on Lot 13 behind Lot 8 and will consent to and sign any document the Vendor may reasonably require to facilitate the development of the complex 4. Vendor, at its sole discretion, may clear and move all trees or such trees as deemed necessary on removal, prior to the completion date. Paragraph 1 of the Schedule of Restrictions attached to the Declaration of Building Scheme reads: 1. No building, fence or other structure shall be erected on the premises and no existing building, fence or other structure shall be added to or extended without the prior written approval of OTTMANN PROPERTIES LTD. (the \"Grantor\"). The design and material for any dwelling must be in conformity with a first-class development of highest stadards and complete plans and specifications (in duplicate) of any proposed building, fence or other structure or of any proposed additions or extensions, together with detailed plans showing the location of the same on the premises, shall be submitted to the Grantor before construction is started and the Grantor shall have power to approve or reject the same. The Grantor reserves the right to require an elevation of the proposed building or structure lower than the maximum permitted by the Municipality's By-laws where in the Grantor's absolute discretion this appears necessary or desirable having regard to topography, the view of adjacent properties, or any other factor. If such plans and specifications shall be approved, one copy thereof shall be retained by the Grantor. The petitioner argues that the restriction is invalid because the respondent imposes it to protect property outside the Building Scheme. In the alternative, the petitioner says that if the respondent has a discretion it acted unreasonably by delaying approval and imposing a height restriction below municipal requirements at the same time as securing municipal approval for heights above those requirements for some of the condominiums on Lot 13. The respondent replies that the discretion is broad enough to protect adjacent properties whether they are in or out of the Building Scheme, and in any event the Contract of Purchase and Sale contains a separate clause for plan approval. On the matter of delay, the respondent says that the petitioner created the problem by failing to supply necessary information as to property ownership when she submitted her plans. Since her property was listed for sale at the time the respondent did not know for whom the plans were submitted. When she clarified the matter the application was processed promptly. Any prejudice or disadvantage suffered by the petitioner could have been avoided if she had made some preliminary enquiries about her house design at an earlier stage. Instead she had the final plans drawn and presented them without prior consultation. I uphold the validity of the restriction. The petitioner (actually, her assignor) granted a wide discretion to the respondent in the matter of building heights. The discretion is controlled by an implied duty of fairness: Behrend v. British Pacific Properties Ltd. (unreported BCSC April 6,1987 Van Reg. No.C852040, Spencer, J). I find nothing unreasonable or unfair about the respondent's determination in this case. The topography of the area is such that each lot can enjoy a lovely view if building heights are controlled. The revision of the petitioner's plans in accordance with the respondent's conditions would not hamper her view but it would remove an obstruction from the dwellings above. This is how the covenant in the Building Scheme is supposed to work. It is not necessary for the respondent to confine itself to the protection of lots within the building scheme. The language of the covenant is expressed in the broadest terms. As well, the Contract of Purchase and Sale obliges the purchaser to obtain the respondent's approval quite apart from the Building Scheme. That term is followed by a paragraph that makes reference to the development of Lot 13 thus forming a context that suggests that the interests of Lot 13 may be considered in the approval process. The doctrine of merger does not apply to this term because paragraph 9 of the Contract of Purchase and Sale states: There are no representations, warranties, guarantees, promises or agreements other than those set out above, all of which will survive the completion of the sale . [emphasis added] The argument that the respondent acted unfairly when it restricted the petitioner while getting over-height approval from the municipality is met by a careful analysis of the manner by which the municipality calculates roof heights. An ordinary peak roof is measured one way (the petitioner's proposed house) and a flat roof (the condominiums in Lot 13), another. The evidence before me is that after making allowances for the differences the respondent stayed within municipal requirements for Lot 13. Even if the Lot 13 structures were above municipal levels, the argument is specious. The repondent's duty is to act fairly in preserving views in the neighbourhood. There is no evidence that the heights designed for Lot 13 will impede anyone's view. I dismiss the petitioner's argument that the subject clauses are void for uncertainty. They are broad, but they are not uncertain. Any arbitrariness or other abuse is controlled by the implied duty of fairness. I accept the respondent's reason for delay in considering the plans. The passage of time was not great in any case; and if time was crucial the petitioner should have pressed the matter more urgently. The cost of redesigning the house could have been avoided if the petitioner had instructed her architect to discuss preliminary plan ideas with the respondent. The petition is dismissed with costs to the respondent. \"The Honourable Mr. Justice Donald\" Vancouver, B.C. January 11, 1990",

POWERS ) AND: ) MASTER OF THE SUPREME COURT ) GLEN RICHARD ESSELMONT ) ) RESPONDENT ) APPEARANCES: DAPHNE SMITH, Q.C. - Counsel for the Petitioner KENNETH M. WALKER - Counsel for the Respondent DATE OF HEARING: December 7, 1994. BACKGROUND: The parties were married in June of 1968 and separated in November 1993 after approximately 25 years of marriage. They have three children who are now on their own, although the children may receive some occasional assistance from their parents. The parties did enter into a separation agreement March 5, 1994. The agreement was entered into without the direct assistance of lawyers. A copy of the agreement is marked as Exhibit \"D\" to Ms. Esselmont's affidavit filed November 8, 1994. The parties met on two or three occasions in the presence of Ms. Esselmont's brother. Mr. Esselmont prepared the first page and I am told that Ms. Esselmont prepared the balance of the agreement. They used an International Self Counsel Press Ltd. form. The agreement purports to be a final settlement between the parties with regard to their rights to property and maintenance or support. (Page 2, paragraph E.) The agreement includes paragraphs 1 to 5 of the International Self Counsel Press form and then skips to paragraphs 11 to 19. There is no indication what paragraphs 6 to 10 inclusive might have covered. The agreement specifically deals with the division of property in paragraphs 11 and 12, and liabilities in paragraphs 11 and 14. Paragraph 16 deals with the matrimonial home. The household items were to be divided evenly and they were to retain their own vehicles and savings and securities were stated to have been previously divided. Life and disability insurance were to \"remain as is until amended\". Mr. Esselmont appears to have been entitled to retain his B.C. Telephone Company pension and his R.R.S.P.s. Ms. Esselmont was entitled to retain her beauty salon, Image Plus Delano's Hairstylists. Mr. Esselmont purchased Ms. Esselmont's interest in the matrimonial home for $52,000.00. Paragraph 17 provides: \" The husband and the wife covenant and agree that this agreement accurately and completely provides for their present and future needs, and each further covenants and agrees that the arrangement herein described constitutes a full, complete, and final settlement of all rights, causes, claims, and demands with respect to support, maintenance, and property.\" The parties signatures on the agreement were witnessed by Ms. Esselmont's brother. Ms. Esselmont does argue that the agreement was intended to deal with the matrimonial home and that they were going to deal with other property matters subsequent to this. She says there was some urgency in getting the agreement signed so that Mr. Esselmont could obtain a mortgage at a low interest rate and pay her out for her interest in the home. Subsequently a disagreement has arisen between the parties as to what matters were or were not settled by the agreement. The divorce petition was issued November 8, 1994 and includes a claim for division of assets and for support. The answer was filed November 19, 1994 and contests the issue of support and division of assets and costs. The answer alleges that the parties are independent and capable of sustaining themselves without the necessity of maintenance for each other. The answer also alleges that with regard to property the parties have divided the family assets in an equal and fair way with the exception of the household contents and pleads the provisions of the separation agreement referred to earlier. Ms. Esselmont filed a notice of motion November 8, 1994 and a claim for a section 44 declaration, no reasonable prospect of reconciliation, has been granted. The issue of interim support was argued and I have reserved my decision. The issue of the maintenance of the medical and dental plans and maintaining Ms. Esselmont as a beneficiary on life insurance and pension plans was not argued and the parties are at liberty to reset that matter for argument if they wish. Mr. Esselmont issued a notice of motion November 19, 1994 asking that Supreme Court action no. 21671 be heard at the same time as the petition in these proceedings. That order was granted on December 7, 1994. The balance of that notice of motion was adjourned generally. The parties were directed to provide lists of assets to each other and arrange for inspection of those assets if necessary. The parties are approximately 49 years of age. Ms. Esselmont is the owner/operator of a beauty salon and has been so since 1987. The property and financial statement indicates that her income is about $1,461.00 per month gross less an allowance for income tax and C.P.P. benefits, leaving a net of approximately $1,241.00. The financial statements for her business indicate the following: Date Drawings Income after expenses December 31, 1992 $18,000.00 $11,700.00 ($975.00/mo.) December 31, 1993 $25,000.00 $15,000.00 ($1,250.00/mo.) September 30, 1994 $13,000.00 ($1,444.44/mo.) Mr. Esselmont argues that Ms. Esselmont is able to take more monies from the business than she alleges and argues that there is $1,400.00 to $1,600.00 per month in cash that is taken from the business. Ms. Esselmont denies this. Mr. Esselmont refers as Exhibit \"B\" to a statement Ms. Esselmont prepared when seeking financing from her bank. This statement shows the net income pursuant to the financial statements but in addition shows expenses of a personal nature that are included as business expenses. Those amounted to $13,000.00 to $14,000.00 in 1992 and approximately $13,000.00 in 1993. These expenses included an auto lease and operating costs, advertising and promotion such as tickets for sporting events, and an amount for travel and meals and miscellaneous expenses. Ms. Esselmont is presently living with her mother although she has purchased a lot and plans to build a home. Her property and financial statements claims expenses of $2,664.62. The allowance for clothing, entertainment and pocket money, each in the amount of $100.00, could be reduced to a total of $150.00. I would eliminate the allowance for R.R.S.P., $300.00, the restaurant expense by $100.00, the gift expense by $100.00, the liquor expense of $25.00 and the vacation expense of $100.00, reducing the total claim for expenses by $775.00, leaving a balance of $1,889.62. It should be noted that included in those expenses are the lease payments for the automobile and operating expenses for the automobile, some of which are covered by the business. In 1993 approximately $5,900.00 or a little more relating to auto expense were covered by the business. That is approximately $490.00 per month. When this is considered Ms. Esselmont's expenses are reduced to approximately $1,400.00 per month. Ms. Esselmont has been able to meet her expenses on a month to month basis since the separation and it is argued that in March of 1994 when she signed the separation agreement she had been separated for five months and was aware of her income situation. Ms. Esselmont is the registered owner of a lot which she plans to build a home on. The lot is valued at $48,500.00 on her property and financial statement. She also has a $14,000.00 interest in property in Arizona and is registered as a one-third owner of her mother's townhouse for estate purposes. Ms. Esselmont's property and financial statement shows that she also has approximately $39,000.00 in savings, T-bills and R.R.S.P.s. These monies came from the buy out of her interest in the matrimonial home. MR. ESSELMONT: Mr. Esselmont has been an employee of B.C. Tel for approximately 29 years. His property and financial statement indicates that he has income of about $3,872.00 per month ($46,464.00 per annum) from employment and rental income of $1,950.00 per month for a total of $5,822.00. His net monthly income is claimed to be $2,380.00 plus the rental income for a total of $4,330.00. His income tax returns for 1991 show income of $51,000.00 per annum and for 1992 income of $59,000.00 per annum from employment. During argument it was acknowledged that his income would be approximately $59,000.00 per annum ($4,916.66 per month). In addition he would have the rental income of $1,950.00. Mr. Esselmont's expenses are claimed at $5,290.07 plus payroll deductions; union dues - $22.00, charity - $14.00, pension payment - $90.00, for a total of $126.00 every two weeks, or $273.00 per month. This does not include U.I.C., C.P.P. and income tax. I have reviewed the expenses and although taxes are claimed under housing generally, they are included in a mortgage payment. I am not sure whether or not there is a duplication of the total of $170.00 claimed per month for taxes on property. The heating and electricity seem high on a monthly basis but the properties are rented. There is $184.00 claimed for repairs and maintenance but no specifics as to what repairs are needed immediately. The telephone expense at $100.00 is high and should be reduced by $50.00 and I would not consider the $50.00 claim for gardening. There is no explanation for the dental payments which are not covered, at $50.00, or the amount claimed for educational expenses at $50.00. I would eliminate all of those. I note that nothing has been claimed for entertainment or pocket money or barber. Nothing has been claimed for restaurant meals, birthdays, gifts. Debts are listed at a total of $1,136.27. On the material before me I would reduce those items which I have already stated, but regarding the balance there is no indication that those expenses are not being incurred. Therefore the expenses, $5,290.00, should be reduced by $384.00 leaving a balance of $4,806.00, plus payroll deductions. These are considerably higher than Ms. Esselmont's expenses but it should be kept in mind that almost $3,000.00 relates to mortgage payments on two pieces of property and $1,136.00 relates to debt servicing. The balance of the expenses ($670.00) are certainly reasonable. The assets which Mr. Esselmont shows on his property and financial statement include: The matrimonial home...................... $185,000.00 A condo purchased after separation........ $85,000.00 Motor vehicles ........................... 12,000.00 A portion of household contents not yet divided. B.C. pension cash surrender value estimated 25,000.00 R.R.S.P.s ................................ 6,800.00 The two savings accounts are over drafted at approximately $3,600.00. He has a small interest in a company. The assets total approximately $310,000.00. The liabilities including mortgages on the two properties and some loans total $266,250.00. On paper it would appear that Mr. Esselmont has about $50,000.00 in equity after consideration of liabilities and Ms. Esselmont has approximately $100,000.00 plus the interest in the business in assets. There is a great deal of difference in earning capacity at this time. Mr. Esselmont can earn approximately $59,000.00 from his employment and Ms. Esselmont has income from the business at approximately $17,500.00 ($1,461.00 per month x 12) plus approximately $13,000.00 in expenses which are paid from the business but which she has some benefit from. Mr. Esselmont argues that no interim order should be made for support for Ms. Esselmont and relies on the provisions of the separation agreement. He argues that the separation agreement was entered into without any coercion and that Ms. Esselmont was well aware of his financial circumstances and her own at the time the agreement was entered into. Ms. Esselmont argues that there were other issues of property which were to be sorted out later and says that because of the discrepancy in their income support should be ordered. Ms. Esselmont also argues that the separation agreement will be challenged. She will be seeking a division of assets different from that provided by the separation agreement. The factors to be taken into consideration in determining support under the Divorce Act include the following: \"15(5) In making an order under this section, the court shall take into consideration the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of each spouse and of any child of the marriage for whom support is sought, including (a) the length of time the spouses cohabited; (b) the functions performed by the spouse during cohabitation; and (c) any order, agreement or arrangement relating to support of the spouse or child.\" The objectives of an order for support are: \"15(7) An order made under this section that provides for the support of a spouse should (a) recognize any economic advantages of disadvantages to the spouses arising from the marriage or its breakdown; (b) apportion between the spouses any financial consequences arising from the care of any child of the marriage over and above the obligation apportioned between the spouses pursuant to subsection (8); (c) relieve any economic hardship of the spouses arising from the breakdown of the marriage; and (d) in so far as practicable, promote the economic self-sufficiency of each spouse within a reasonable period of time.\" The parties have entered into an agreement which appears to deal with the property issues between them. There is an argument whether or not that is a fair agreement or whether the court should vary the division provided for by that agreement. The agreement states that it completely provides for their present and future needs and is a full and final settlement of all rights including support or maintenance. (Paragraph 17) The parties separated in November of 1993 and the agreement was made in March 1994. There has been no claim for support by Ms. Esselmont until the commencement of these proceedings. In fact, during a period of time when she occupied the matrimonial home after Mr. Esselmont had purchased her interest, Ms. Esselmont paid $400.00 per month towards expenses relating to that home. Ms. Esselmont appears to be meeting her ongoing expenses on a day to day basis, although I acknowledge she may have problems financing the construction of a home in her present situation. Mr. Esselmont appears to have acquired assets and liabilities. The debts which he has taken on would affect his ability to pay support at this time. I am not making any determination about whether the agreement between the parties is valid or whether after trial it will withstand a challenge by Ms. Esselmont. However on an interim basis I am satisfied that I should not ignore the agreement in this case. The court may well decide at the trial that given the differences between their respective earning abilities and in considering the division of assets, that support is payable from Mr. Esselmont to Ms. Esselmont. However on an interim basis I am satisfied that I should not ignore the provisions of the agreement. The court should not ignore the maintenance provisions agreed to by the parties without good reason ( Charles v. Charles (1991) 32 R.F.L. (3d) 316 (B.C.S.C.) Bouck J.). I do recognize however that on an interim application the weight of the separation agreement may not be as great as it would be on a final application. ( Ziniuk v. Ziniuk (1986) 2 R.F.L. (3d) 398 (B.C.C.A.)) In light of the parties actions since the separation and since the separation agreement, including the fact that Ms. Esselmont appears to be able to meet her ongoing expenses and Mr. Esselmont has changed his financial position by taking on additional debt to acquire assets, I am not prepared to ignore the separation agreement on this application for interim support. Therefore the application for interim support is dismissed. There should include liberty to apply in the event there is a change of circumstance.

        "text": "Citation: Emerson v. I.C.B.C. et al Date: 20000106 2000 BCSC 12 Docket: 97 4408 Registry: Victoria IN THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA BETWEEN: KIM EMERSON PLAINTIFF AND: INSURANCE CORPORATION OF BRITISH COLUMBIA, JOHN DOE AND JANE DOE DEFENDANTS REASONS FOR JUDGMENT OF THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE LOWRY Counsel for the Plaintiff: D.E. Tourell Counsel for the Defendants and Ernest Crockford: R.A.W. Trann Place and Date of Hearing: Victoria, B.C. December 14 - 17, 1999 [1] In November 1995, Kim Emerson fell and fractured her ankle while she was offering assistance to an elderly couple who had driven off of the road. She did not determine their identity. Her injury did not heal well and it has had a very significant impact on her life. Within two years, she commenced this \"unascertainable driver\" action against the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (\"ICBC\") alleging the driver was negligent and claiming to be entitled to compensatory damages as a rescuer. Liability and the quantum of the damages claimed are both in dispute. Subsequently, long after an action against him became time-barred, the driver was identified as Ernest Crockford. The governing legislation mandates that he be substituted for ICBC in this action despite the time elapsed. The parties join issue over the effect of that requirement on the case Ms. Emerson must prove. [2] Before her claim against Mr. Crockford can be considered on its merits, it is necessary to determine whether she must establish she could have proven a case against ICBC had his identity remained unknown to her, and, if so, whether that has been established. The Case to be Proven [3] An action against ICBC as a nominal defendant is created under s. 24 of the Insurance (Motor Vehicle) Act , R.S.B.C 1996, c. 231 which provides in material respects as follows: [4] Thus, by virtue of subss. (1) and (5), an action for damages that could be brought against the owner and driver of a vehicle that causes injury can be brought against ICBC if their identity could not be ascertained and the claimant has employed all reasonable efforts to determine who they were. The words \"not ascertainable\" have been interpreted to mean \"could not have been ascertained had the claimant made all reasonable efforts, having regard to the claimant's position, to discover them\". \"Reasonable efforts\" may be said to be those that a reasonable person would take who wished to protect any rights arising out of the accident whatever they might be: Leggett v. Insurance Corp. of British Columbia (1992), 72 B.C.L.R. (2d) 201 (C.A.) at para. 11-15. [5] Ms. Emerson contends that, because Mr. Crockford's identity has been ascertained before judgment, and subs. (6) mandates that he be substituted for ICBC, she does not have to prove that his identity was not ascertainable to her or that she made reasonable efforts to determine it. She says subs. (6) serves to overcome any time-bar and permits her to prosecute an action against him even if she could have ascertained his identity before commencing action against ICBC. This she would say is so even if Mr. Crockford was not insured by ICBC because subs. (6) is not confined to owners and drivers insured by ICBC. [6] In my view, Ms. Emerson's contention is not tenable. Subsection (6) does not provide for the commencement of a second action. It does not alter the time within which an action can be commenced. It provides for the substitution of the identified owner or driver in place of the nominal defendant against which a valid action has been commenced within time. [7] Ms. Emerson could not maintain the action she commenced against ICBC at all unless the identity of Mr. Crockford was not ascertainable and she made the reasonable efforts required. If it was ascertainable, or if she failed to make reasonable efforts to determine his identity, she had no cause of action and no basis on which she could bring the action against the nominal defendant for which Mr. Crockford is to be substituted. Put another way, subs. (6) mandates the substitution of an owner or driver who is ascertained before judgment after the time for commencing an action has passed only where there exists a valid action against the nominal defendant. I consider that in order to succeed against Mr. Crockford, Ms. Emerson must prove that she had a valid cause of action against ICBC. That means proving that Mr. Crockford's identity was not ascertainable and that she made reasonable efforts to identify him. [8] I find support for this view in what was said in obiter in Tse v. Insurance Corp. of British Columbia , [1996] B.C.J. No. 1192 (S.C.). There the court was considering an application to substitute as mandated by subs. (6). While Ms. Emerson's contention was not advanced there, it was recognized that ascertaining the identity of a driver before judgment did not obviate a plaintiff's burden of establishing that his identity was not ascertainable before the action was commenced. At para. 22 the chambers judge said: [9] I would, however, respectfully suggest that somewhat understates the position. It seems to me that it would not be for the nominal defendant but rather for the substituted defendant to make the application for a summary disposition and that if it were successful the action would have to be dismissed. [10] In any event, having concluded that Ms. Emerson must establish a valid cause of action against ICBC under s. 24 to succeed against Mr. Crockford, I turn to consider what she has proven in that regard. Mr. Crockford's Identity [11] As indicated, Ms. Emerson must prove two things. First, she must prove that the identity of Mr. Crockford was not ascertainable, meaning it could not be determined with certainty by someone in her position, making the efforts a reasonable person who wished to protect such rights as she might have, would make. Second, she must prove that she in fact made those efforts. Proof of the second will of course prove the first. [12] When Ms. Emerson was injured, it was dark and raining hard. She had stopped her car, leaving her young son and daughter inside, and gone to see if Mr. Crockford and his wife needed assistance. She fell into some water in a shallow grassy ditch as she made her way around the Crockford's car. She experienced immediate pain in her ankle that was excruciating. Her daughter, who was the first to reach her, became hysterical. [13] Various people helped. One was an off-duty ambulance attendant who assessed Ms. Emerson and attended to her ankle. An ambulance was called. While waiting for it to arrive, Ms. Emerson asked that her neighbour, Denise Beland, be called and shortly thereafter she arrived and took charge of the children. When the ambulance arrived, Ms. Emerson was lifted by stretcher from where she had fallen and placed inside. There she spoke briefly with a policeman before being driven a short distance to a hospital. [14] She did not see the Crockfords after she fell until some time later at the hospital. She had by then been given some medication for her pain. They attended to inquire about her condition and brought her flowers. They spoke with her for a minute or two. Their conversation was cut short when the medical staff took Ms. Emerson to be x-rayed. She determined that the Crockfords lived nearby but did not ask their name. [15] Ms. Emerson did not concern herself with the Crockford's identity at all until more than a year had elapsed. ICBC provided her with accident benefits that assisted with her income, treatment and care. I understand that what Ms. Emerson received was consistent with what she would have received if, through the fault of no one else, she had been injured in operating her car. [16] In March 1996 a dispute arose over her physiotherapy expenses. She consulted a solicitor who spoke with ICBC and the prospect of a claim against the driver of the car was raised. The adjuster involved, Aaron Baxter, mistakenly told the solicitor that he had the driver's identity on file and would provide it to Ms. Emerson if she asked him for it. She never did, and in December he advised another solicitor, who Ms. Emerson had subsequently retained, that he did not have the information he assumed he had. Ms. Emerson was then advised she should make efforts to ascertain who had been driving the car. [17] She says she did three things in particular. She spoke to the policeman who attended but he had no record of the driver's identity, although he did tell her that the car had been towed back on to the road and suggested she contact towing companies that might have attended. She thought she could recognize the car (larger size, white, four door vehicle) so she spent time canvassing the area where the Crockfords had said they lived, but to no avail. And, over a period of a couple of weeks she telephoned towing companies listed in either the 1996 or 1997 Yellow Pages seeking any record of the tow, again to no avail. [18] Her evidence with respect to calling towing companies is, however, flawed. A few months ago she swore (for the purposes of a Rule 18A application) that she made a list from the Yellow Pages of all the towing companies in the Victoria area - 22 of them - and telephoned each of them. The list she has produced contains 22 companies in alphabetical order with telephone numbers. But she now says that: all were not drawn from the Yellow Pages; some of the telephone numbers were given to her in the course of her inquiries; she made the list from notes a short time after the calls were all completed; and it shows only those companies who responded either at the time she called or when they called her back. [19] She says this when shown that some of the companies she has listed do not appear in the 1996 or 1997 Yellow Pages at all. Others that do are not on her list. [20] But what she says does not address the additional fact that at least one of the companies on her list did not even commence business and start using the telephone number she recorded until the fall of 1998. Another, which was operating in 1996 and 1997 did not appear in the Yellow Pages under the name Ms. Emerson recorded until 1998. [21] It is only in the 1999 Yellow Pages that all of the companies listed by Ms. Emerson are to be found. Further, companies that appear in the 1996 or 1997 Yellow Pages that are not on her list do not appear in the 1999 Yellow Pages. While I do not doubt that Ms. Emerson did make inquiries of some towing companies, her list appears to be a fabrication made from the 1999 Yellow Pages. The result is that there is no evidence of what companies she contacted, and no sound basis on which it can be accepted that she contacted all of the towing companies in the Victoria area. [22] Ms. Emerson did speak with one of the ambulance attendants. Christopher Meyer lives in her neighbourhood. She says that she met him largely by chance and inquired whether he would have recorded any information when he attended the scene that could assist her in identifying the driver. She was given to understand that there would have been none. Strangely, however, Mr. Meyer did in fact record the licence number of Mr. Crockford's car on the standard form Ambulance Crew Report which was part of Ms. Emerson's hospital records. Mr. Meyer now has no recollection of speaking to Ms. Emerson but accepts that his recording the licence number of Mr. Crockford's car was largely a \"fluke\". [23] The hospital records, which consist of 38 pages, were reviewed by Ms. Emerson and her solicitor in May 1996 with respect to her injury and its treatment, but they did not notice the licence plate number entered on the Crew Report. Ms. Emerson did not attempt to contact the second ambulance attendant, David Booth. He is somewhat at odds with Mr. Meyer. He says that attendants are supposed to take care to see that licence plate numbers are recorded on the Crew Report. Four months ago, the record of the licence plate number was drawn to the attention of defence counsel in the course of a meeting with Mr. Meyer and Mr. Booth. It permitted Mr. Crockford's identity to be easily ascertained. [24] In my view, it is not necessary to consider whether Ms. Emerson's contact with the Crockfords following the accident or the record of the licence number of Mr. Crockford's car rendered his identity ascertainable. The evidence pertaining to the inquiries Ms. Emerson made of towing companies defeats her ability to prove that Mr. Crockford's identity was not ascertainable. [25] A reasonable person in Ms. Emerson's position would, with the information she had, have followed the policeman's advice and contacted all of the towing companies in the Victoria area as she has said she did. But her assertion in that regard is now so undermined that she cannot be said to have proven she made reasonable efforts to determine Mr. Crockford's identity. It may well be that, had she actually made inquiry of all of the towing companies listed in the 1996 or 1997 Yellow Pages, a record of the tow would have been found. Given that there is now no reliable evidence that she did so, it cannot be said that Mr. Crockford's identity could not have been ascertained. Conclusion [26] I conclude then that the threshold issue as to whether Ms. Emerson must prove, and whether she has proven, that Mr. Crockford's identity was not ascertainable is to be decided against her. This renders consideration of the merits of her case against him unnecessary. Disposition [27] The action will be dismissed. \"Lowry J.\"",

        "text": " No. 14641 Kelowna Registry IN THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA (IN CHAMBERS) 4 January 1994 BETWEEN: ) ) HERMANN ECKER ) REASONS FOR JUDGMENT ) (PLAINTIFF) ) ) OF THE HONOURABLE AND: ) ) CAL SCOUTEN and AND ) CAROL PATRICIA ANNE SCOUTEN ) MR. JUSTICE WILKINSON ) (RESPONDENT) ) C.R. PENTY, Esq., for the Plaintiff H.R. BERGE, Esq., for the Defendants THE COURT: (ORAL) This is an appeal from a decision of the Master made October 27th, 1993. The Master was making a ruling under Rule 18 and/or Rule 31. He was ruling on a motion to dismiss certain portions of the plaintiff's claim in this action and those portions were the claims of the plaintiff to have a declaration of trust concerning a house in the name of Ms. Scouten. The facts are set out in the decision of the Master and the facts disclose that what appears to me to have been a loan was made by the plaintiff to the defendant, Mr. Scouten, in order to assist him in buying a house at the time he was commencing employment with the plaintiff. Very briefly, the funds were requested by Mr. Scouten of the plaintiff on certain terms that I will refer to later. The funds were then advanced by the plaintiff to the solicitors for Mr. Scouten. The same solicitors were apparently acting for Ms. Scouten. It appears that the original view was that the property would be purchased in the name of Mr. Scouten although there is some reference later on to an interim agreement being signed by both Mr. and Ms. Scouten as purchasers. In fact, what took place after the funds were advanced was that the solicitors used the funds to purchase the property and put it entirely in the name of Ms. Scouten. The plaintiff, after a falling out between himself and Mr. Scouten, then brought this action claiming, in essence, some form of trust or interest in the property and a Lis Pendens to secure his claim pending trial. The plaintiff's claim appears to be based in trust although there is a reference to an agreement to give a mortgage, and constructive trust and resulting trust were also brought up before the Master. I am profoundly unhappy with the pleadings, but the defendants have taken the position that I should deal with the substance of the claim in trust and deal with the matter of amendments later. In essence, the Master found that there was not a constructive trust because there was a juristic reason for the advance of funds, namely; the fact that the monies were lent. He also found that as far as a resulting trust was concerned that there was no agreement, or intention that some or all of the property would be returned to the settler. I accept that the law as to the function of the Master hearing this application was as set out by Mr. Berge, for the defendants, and that my function on appeal is as set out in Mr. Berge's brief. Mr. Berge posits that the test for the Master was whether or not there was a real and substantial issue to be tried and that his function was not to determine disputed questions of fact or law, either under Rule 31 or Rule 18, and that my function is to determine whether his decision was clearly wrong or demonstrates an error in principle. I have no difficulty with the finding of the Master that the transaction in question was a loan. What I do have difficulty with is the terms under which that loan was made or expressed otherwise, the inducement or representation made by Mr. Scouten in order to secure the loan and funds. In Exhibit K to Mr. Scouten's affidavit of April 13th there is a note or a portion of a note from him to Mr. Ecker and it says: \"As I see it you should be protected. The house should be in your name with me purchasing it from you on an agreement for sale also I can re-mortgage and pay down after you return.\" (Quoted as Read) In my view, this whole case boils down to the question of whether or not those words form the basis on which these monies were advanced and whether or not that basis was that the plaintiff would be secured by way of title or some other charge upon the property in question. If Mr. Scouten, in fact, was obliged to do that or undertook some trust obligation against the property or an interest in it to protect or secure the plaintiff and took the money on that basis and used the money on that basis and acquired the property on that basis, then it seems to me that there is a triable issue as to whether that gives rise to a trust obligation with reference to the property itself. There are a number of matters that will have to be gone into as to the exact arrangements with the solicitors and what the knowledge of the solicitors and Ms. Scouten was, but it appears to me that in carrying out his judicial functions in this case, the Master ought to have factored into account those statements in Exhibit K which preceded the advancement of the funds. It also appears to me that when one has taken that statement into account there is a triable issue. As I have said before I am profoundly unhappy with the pleadings in this case. It appears to me that perhaps what is really being dealt with is an express trust rather than a resulting or constructive trust. With reference to a constructive trust it seems to me that a successful claim by the plaintiff would at the least have to involve the plaintiff raising an estoppel against the defendant, saying in effect you cannot raise the loan as a juristic reason for the advance of the these funds unless you also acknowledge your obligation to give me some protection or security against the property. But, as I say, my intention is simply to give the plaintiff leave to amend his claim and to finally get these pleadings into a state where both parties can be satisfied that they are fixed. As I say, it seems to me that the excerpt from Exhibit K taken together with all the other material properly before me does raise a triable issue. It appears to me from my perusal of the Master's reasons that he did not take that particular evidence into account, and that in itself would be error on his part. The issue is not simply was the matter a loan, but was it a loan that was made with certain conditions or terms attached, and specifically as set out in Exhibit K. Accordingly, I allow the appeal against the ruling of the Master. In view of the state of the pleadings, including those that the plaintiff says it intends to file. I am not disposed to allow costs on the appeal. There will be an additional order that the plaintiff have a period of time to make appropriate amendments. MR. PENTY: Yes, My Lord, trial is set for March 7th, and also I won't be using those exact amendments I've put in, in light of Your Lordship's remarks regarding express trust and estoppel, I will be rewording those, but I can have them within, I would think, a week or so. THE COURT: Ten days. MR. PENTY: Ten days would be good for me. MR. BERGE: Well, I'd also like leave to bring another application if my friend is going to amend the pleadings and we're going to have further examination for discovery -- THE COURT: I do not think there is any doubt whatsoever you are entitled to have further discovery. MR. BERGE: Well -- but I want also leave to bring a further application for judgment as a result of the pleadings and further discovery. THE COURT: Anything wrong with that? MR. PENTY: No, I would like to preserve the trial date. It's been set, this is the second time already, but I have no objection to further discoveries or -- THE COURT: We11, that's not necessarily going to affect the trial date. M.R. PENTY: No, I am just dealing with the -- THE COURT: What about the time limits now? There may be further discovery on both your parts -- MR. PENTY: Yes, that's -- THE COURT: -- following these amendments it seems to me. MR. PENTY: -- there may be. I know that Mr. Berge has some holidays planned. I myself have a week of holidays planned in February, but the -- we should perhaps deal with the amendments first on both sides in the sense that my pleadings within ten days and Mr. Berge's back within ten days. Is that kind of reasonable? And then kind of march the time from there as to have all discoveries concluded, based on those amendments, by the third week in February. I am just proposing these dates as a -- MR. BERGE: Well, I am going -- THE COURT: Do you want me setting time limits that far ahead -- MR. BERGE: No. THE COURT: -- or should I just set the time limit on the amendments? MR. BERGE: I think -- I would prefer that you simply set the time limits on the amendments, and then I think the Rules say if there is amendments I have so long to do whatever it is, ten days or whatever it is after that so, and then I think everything else will fall in the fullness of time. MR. PENTY: Yes, that's fine,. THE COURT: All right. Thank you both. MR. BERGE: Thank you. MR. PENTY: Thank you, My Lord.

        "text": "Date of Release: January 4, 1993 No. B902885 Vancouver Registry IN THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA ) BETWEEN: ) ) GURDIAL SINGH DHA ) REASONS FOR JUDGMENT ) PLAINTIFF ) ) OF THE HONOURABLE AND: ) ) MARIE YEUNG ) MR. JUSTICE MACKOFF ) DEFENDANT ) ) Counsel for the Plaintiff: G.V.R. Keirstead Counsel for the Defendant: A.C. Ward Dates and Place of Trial: October 1 & 2, 1992 Vancouver, B.C. The plaintiff, who is now 48 years of age, claims damages for injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident. On December 28, 1989 at approximately 7:00 p.m., the plaintiff and his wife were in their automobile travelling east on Gilpin Avenue in Burnaby on their way to visit a friend who lived on that street. They had never been to the friend's house before. In order to enable him to find the address, which was across the street, Mr. Dha told his wife, who was driving, to pull over onto the shoulder of the road. She did so in mid block. The plaintiff got out and went to the rear of the vehicle. He looked to his left and saw that there were no cars coming from that direction. He looked to his right and saw the headlights of an approaching vehicle. He stated that he assumed or thought that he could safely cross the street before the vehicle came to where he was about to cross. Once he started to cross he looked straight ahead and did not look to his right again. He said that the street was quite dark. In chief he said that as he was crossing he walked at a normal pace. On cross-examination he said that he was walking a little faster than at a normal pace. Gilpin Avenue is a two lane street with a gravel shoulder on each side of the road. Mr. Dha testified that he was almost across the street, with one foot on the blacktop and one foot on the gravel shoulder, when he felt a push on his right side and heard the squeal of tires. He thought that he had been pushed by the right side front bumper of the car. He said that although he was not thrown by the force of the impact, it did cause him to fall onto the gravel shoulder. When he looked up he saw that the car had come to a stop where he had fallen. The defendant testified that about 6:45 p.m. she was driving her 1985 Volvo in the westbound lane on Gilpin Avenue. The road was a little damp. Her automobile was in good condition and her headlights were on. She stated that she was familiar with the area. Although there are street lights on Gilpin, they are far apart and the road was dark in certain areas. Suddenly, she saw a person appear in the middle of her lane. He was about 10 to 15 feet or a car length in front of her. She slammed on her brakes and the extreme right side of the front fender struck the plaintiff causing him to fall onto the shoulder of the road. Mrs. Yeung said that although she did not see the plaintiff running she assumed that he was because he appeared so suddenly. Her car came to a stop in a straight line a few feet from where he was lying. She said that just before she saw him she was travelling at 30 m.p.h. or less because of the darkness of the road. As she was driving she was looking straight ahead and her attention had not been diverted by anything. She said that she did not sound her horn because it all happened so quickly that all she could do was to slam on her brakes. After she had walked over to see how the plaintiff was, she went to the nearest house and called the police. Clearly the plaintiff was the primary cause of his own misfortune. He was negligent in crossing in the middle of the block having seen the headlights of an approaching vehicle from his right. Since it was dark, he should have realized that it was dangerous to guess as to the distance between himself and the oncoming headlights. Added to that danger was the fact that other than seeing the oncoming headlights, he had no way of gauging the speed of the vehicle with any degree of accuracy. For his own safety he should have waited for the vehicle to pass by before he started to cross. He compounded his negligence in that although he was aware of the presence of an oncoming vehicle, travelling at an unknown speed, he looked straight ahead as he walked and did not look to his right again in order to ascertain the whereabouts of the oncoming vehicle. In so doing he was not only negligent but he also failed to yield the right-of-way to the defendant contrary to provisions of s. 182 of the Motor Vehicle Act . Counsel for the plaintiff submits that since the plaintiff was wearing a camel coloured coat, the defendant should have seen him before he reached the middle of her lane. I do not agree. It is common ground that Gilpin Avenue is a poorly lit street and it was dark where the plaintiff was crossing. Furthermore, it is clear on the evidence that the defendant was travelling on the extreme right side of her lane. That is borne out by the fact that it was the extreme right side of her fender or bumper which pushed the plaintiff, as a result of which he, being almost across the road, fell on the gravel shoulder. Thus, from that position on the straight road her headlights would make the plaintiff visible to her only when he suddenly appeared in the middle of her lane of travel. However, the defendant was contributorily negligent. I accept Mrs. Yeung's evidence that she first saw the plaintiff when he appeared suddenly in the middle of her lane of travel and that upon seeing him she slammed on her brakes. I also accept her evidence that she was travelling at approximately 30 m.p.h. However, I am unable to accept her evidence that the plaintiff was approximately 10-15 feet or one car length in front of her when she saw him and applied her brakes. Given her stated speed and the fact that she came to a stop where the defendant had fallen, it would have been impossible for her to bring her vehicle to a stop in that short a distance. It is a well known fact that in the time that it takes a motorist travelling at 30 m.p.h. to apply his/her brakes and come to a stop, the vehicle will have travelled 80-90 feet. I, therefore, conclude that the plaintiff must have been between 80-90 feet from the defendant when she saw him and applied her brakes. Given that she was that far from the plaintiff, Mrs. Yeung was negligent in failing to take any evasive action whatsoever to avoid striking the plaintiff. Furthermore, she failed to give a warning by sounding the horn of her vehicle contrary to the provision of s. 183(b) of the Motor Vehicle Act . I apportion liability at 60% against the plaintiff and 40% against the defendant. From the scene of the accident the plaintiff was taken by ambulance to the Burnaby General Hospital. He was examined by a doctor who found no fractures. The doctor dressed the plaintiff's wounds, gave him painkillers and sent him home. The following day Mr. Dha saw his family doctor with complaints of pain of his hip, neck and shoulder and upper back. These injuries cleared up in three or four weeks. In addition to the above he had a swollen right thumb which pained him. As well his left knee was stiff and swollen which caused him pain when stressed. He was told to rest and to take analgesics. His doctor also told him to apply ice. In accordance with the doctor's instructions, he returned on January 2 and January 5, 1990. His right thumb was still swollen and painful and he had difficulty in grasping with his right hand. The thumb injury was classified as a severe sprain or extension beyond the normal range and movement for that joint. His left knee was painful. The doctor advised that he not return to work and to exercise his left knee with quadriceps exercises. The plaintiff followed those instructions. He returned to the doctor on January 9 and 16. Examination showed right thumb tenderness and tenderness over his left knee medial collateral ligaments. He was unable to squat or to kneel and found it impossible to remain standing for prolonged periods. The doctor sent him to a physiotherapist for treatment. The plaintiff next saw the doctor on January 23 and 26. He had pain on the medial aspect of the left knee joint. The doctor found some evidence of fluid in the joint as well as some lateral instability. The right thumb swelling and tenderness were unchanged. The doctor referred him to an orthopaedic surgeon who saw him on February 12. The orthopaedic surgeon felt that the plaintiff might benefit from further physiotherapy and a stabilization brace for his left knee. He was fitted with a brace in late March. On April 3, 1990, the plaintiff returned to his job as an assistant lathe operator with Westcoast Plywood Co. Limited. After four or five hours at work his brace became very tight and when it was removed he found that his knee was swollen. His thumb had also swollen. On April 5, he went to his doctor who advised him to remain off work, to attend the physiotherapist and to again see the orthopaedic surgeon. The plaintiff continued to see his doctor at regular intervals. By May 10 his knee was considerably stronger and more comfortable. With his brace on he was able to jog and ride his bicycle. His doctor encouraged him to do so. On May 28 it was agreed that he would do a work trial and report back in a week. On June 4, 1990 the plaintiff returned to work. Although there was swelling of the left knee and right thumb at the end of a shift, the plaintiff elected to continue working. He was only able to work with his brace on. His right thumb continued to bother him and that discomfort increased with use. The thumb problem resolved some time after October, 1990. The orthopaedic surgeon had evaluated the knee on several occasions. His clinical diagnosis was that the plaintiff had a torn medial meniscus. The knee had not responded well to conservative treatment and was a continuing problem to the plaintiff. Therefore, on November 26, 1990 the surgeon suggested an arthroscopic examination of the knee. The plaintiff agreed and the doctor made the necessary arrangements. However, Mr. Dha changed his mind because a friend, who had an unsuccessful knee surgery, advised that he only have the surgery as a last resort. The plaintiff returned to the orthopaedic surgeon in late 1991 because of his continuing knee problems. On February 20, 1992 he underwent arthroscopic surgery under local anaesthetic. The intra-operative findings showed that he had a flap tear of the anterior horn of the medial meniscus with extension radially into the edge. Therefore, the surgeon performed a partial maniscectomy. Mr. Dha returned to work two and a half weeks after the surgery. Within a few months he had made a complete recovery and has had no further problems with his left knee. I have read the cases relating to awards of non-pecuniary damages cited by both counsel. However, the facts in those cases differ substantially from the particular facts herein. In my view, the appropriate award for non-pecuniary damages is $25,000. In summary the plaintiff's damages are as follows: Non-pecuniary $25,000.00 Wage loss (as agreed) $13,145.86 Total $$38,145.86 Therefore, the plaintiff will have judgment in the sum of $15,258.35, being 40% of the total damages suffered. He will also have pre-judgment interest on 40% of the non-pecuniary damages, at the rate set by the Registrar, from December 28, 1989. The plaintiff and the defendant are each awarded their proportionate costs pursuant to the Negligence Act . Costs are fixed at Scale 3. \"MACKOFF J.\" Vancouver, B.C. January 4, 1993",

JUSTICE BOUCK firm name and style of ) SKEENA BROADCASTERS, and the said ) SKEENA BROADCASTERS and ) SHARON TAYLOR ) ) DEFENDANTS ) ) Counsel for the Plaintiff: Kimball R. Nichols Counsel for the Defendants: Don Baron Place and Date of Trial: Vancouver, B.C. 3 - 5 January 1995 INTRODUCTION 1 Fred Derosa is a copywriter. Okanagan Skeena Group Ltd. (Skeena) broadcasts radio and television programs in Terrace, B.C. In 1990, it had about 60 employees. At all material times, Sharon Taylor was the person in charge of Personnel and Administration for Skeena at its Terrace offices. 2 In April 1990, Skeena hired Mr. DeRosa as head of the Copy Department. Differences arose between him and Skeena as to the terms of his employment. Mr. DeRosa claims that Skeena did not allow him to conduct his work as it promised. On 17 August 1990, he submitted his letter of resignation dated 6 August 1990. 3 In his statement of claim he alleges that Skeena and Ms. Taylor made pre-hiring promises and representations to him that amounted to fraudulent or negligent misrepresentations. He now seeks from them an award of general, special, aggravated and punitive damages. His total damage claim except for special damages is alleged to be in the range of $10,000.00. His special damages involve moving expenses. They amount to $6,695.60. He does not claim damages for wrongful or constructive dismissal. 4 The defendants deny liability. They also contend that the plaintiff is prevented from succeeding on his claim for at least two reasons. First, on 9 July 1991, he brought an action in the Provincial Court - Small Claims Division against Skeena for essentially the same cause of action and lost. Skeena says this creates an issue estoppel and the dispute is res judicata . 5 Second, Mr. DeRosa was a member of a union covered by a collective agreement while he was an employee of Skeena. That agreement provided for the arbitration of any complaint or claim brought by an employee concerning working conditions. Mr. DeRosa did not invoke the provisions of the collective agreement. Instead, he elected to sue both defendants. Because the dispute was arbitrable under the collective agreement, the defendants argue that the court lacks jurisdiction. 6 Skeena also counterclaims for damages against Mr. DeRosa on the grounds of abuse of process. FACTS 7 Mr. DeRosa was 41 years old in the spring of 1990. He was living in the Toronto area. On 10 March 1990, he sent a letter to Skeena seeking employment. On 27 March 1990, Ms. Taylor replied to the letter by way of a telephone call. Ms. Taylor and Mr. DeRosa discussed his qualifications and his ideas for changing the operation of Skeena's Copy Department. After checking with her superiors, Ms. Taylor called back a few days later and offered the job to Mr. DeRosa. He accepted. 8 On 3 April 1990, Ms. Taylor sent Mr. DeRosa a letter of confirmation. The relevant part reads: Your past experience with the Columbine system will be a great asset, and as promised, you will be free to set up the system to your specifications so that there is a tight control on facilities orders and carts. I don't anticipate any problems in turning this over to your department. 9 The plaintiff took this letter and other alleged pre-contractual verbal assurances as a commitment that he could organize and administer the Copy Department the way he desired. In his statement of claim he alleges that Skeena agreed he would be in charge of and have authority to implement an administrative system for the Copy Department of Skeena to his specifications. 10 The defendants say that no such promise was ever made. They admit that Skeena agreed to transfer certain responsibilities from the Traffic Department to the Copy Department but they deny they agreed to give him a completely free hand to operate as he pleased. 11 Nonetheless, in May of 1990 Skeena gave him the opportunity of designing and implementing his own system. After a short try out, Skeena found it didn't work. Other Departments of Skeena that had to coordinate their activities with the Copy Department complained. The system was then restored to its previous arrangement except for a few variations designed to accommodate the wishes of the plaintiff. 12 Mr. DeRosa continued working for Skeena but he was an unhappy man. On 17 August 1990 he tendered his resignation. In that letter he said: I am leaving because I feel that my philosophies on running a radio station creative department are not suitable for the particular demands and requirements of Skeena Broadcasters. 13 He did not complain in the letter that the defendants failed to live up to any pre-hiring commitments. 14 Skeena still tried to salvage the situation. It wished to retain Mr. DeRosa as a valued employee. It asked him to put in writing the changes he would like to make. He did so. Mr. DeRosa, representatives of Skeena management and personnel from associated Departments got together and discussed his proposals. Unfortunately, they could not reach a consensus. Mr. DeRosa then confirmed his resignation, but he agreed to stay on with the company until it found a replacement. On 19 October 1990 he left for good. 15 While Mr. DeRosa worked for Skeena he was a member of the National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians - CLC (NABET). NABET had a collective agreement with Skeena during that time period. It provided for the settlement of disputes between employees and the company by way of a grievance and arbitration procedure. The relevant clause reads in part as follows: 7.1 \"Grievance\" shall mean any complaint or claim brought by an employee ... concerning ... work or working conditions... 16 The collective agreement goes on to describe the machinery for resolving such disputes by way of arbitration. 17 On 19 July 1991, Mr. DeRosa filed a Notice of Claim in the Terrace Registry of the Provincial Court of British Columbia (Small Claims Court). He named Skeena as the defendant. He described his claim against Skeena in these words: The claimant was offered employment with the Skeena Broadcasters Division of Okanagan Skeena Group Limited on or about 29 March 1990. The claimant made such personal and financial sacrifices to reach the job site in Terrace to accept the position offered. The job did not conform to what was originally promised. The claimant would not have accepted the job had he known what it would be. Mr. DeRosa then claimed damages as follows: a) moving expenses $4,076.18 Toronto to Terrace b) net loss of income 2,727.40 Total $6,803.58 18 In a letter to the Canada Labour Relations Board dated 19 April 1992, Mr. DeRosa stated: I decided to sue the company for breach of contract and misrepresentation. I pursued my case through the small claims court... 19 The Small Claims Court judge dismissed his claim. The court order dated 19 February 1992 reads in part: This court orders: This claim is dismissed. No jurisdiction in this court; Mr. DeRosa has not established that there was a breach of contract. No order of costs in favour of the defendant. 20 Mr. DeRosa then brought this action in the Supreme Court. Essentially, he relies on the same grounds that he put forward in his suit in the Small Claims Court. ANALYSIS 21 Mr. DeRosa's claim depends upon his version of the pre-contractual oral discussions between Ms. Taylor as well as the Skeena letter of 3 April 1990. If his interpretation of these matters is rejected his action must fail. It would remain as simply a situation where he was hired, became unhappy with his job and quit. If he is believed, then he may have the right to recover damages from the defendants. See for example: Wainwright et al . v. Vancouver Shipyards Co, Ltd. et al . (1987), 14 B.C.L.R. (2d) 247 (B.C.C.A.); Johnston v. Dresser Industries Ltd . (1990), 75 O.R. (2d) 609 (Ont. C.A.), etc. 22 The burden of proof is on Mr. DeRosa to prove three ingredients on a balance of probabilities. First, that the long-distance telephone calls and the letter of 3 April 1990 amounted to a pre-hiring contract between him and Skeena. Second, that in those calls and the letter, the parties agreed he would be in charge of Copy Department at Terrace and he would be free to implement an administrative system to his specifications. Third, that the pre-hiring oral or written representations of Ms. Taylor and Skeena were made fraudulently or negligently. 23 The evidence relating to the pre-employment long-distance telephone calls falls well short of proving the agreement alleged by the plaintiff. Ms. Taylor and Mr. DeRosa had never met before. It seems unreasonable to suppose that Skeena would give the plaintiff the broad authority he says he received in these one or two pre-contractual long-distance telephone calls when no one in the Terrace office of Skeena even knew him. All they had was a copy of his resume or application for employment. 24 The essence of Skeena's operations was that each department worked in cooperation with the others. Unless management agreed, one could not dictate to the others. If the argument of Mr. DeRosa is accepted in its literal form, he had the right to devise a scheme for the Copy Department regardless of the effect it had on other departments. Why would Skeena agree to putting the operation of the Copy Department into the hands of an unknown such as Mr. DeRosa and accepting the outcome, whatever that might be? 25 At the time of the telephone conversations, Mr. DeRosa had never been to Terrace. He knew nothing about Skeena's physical plant. He had little information concerning its overall operating procedures. In these circumstances it seems unreasonable that he would commit himself to successfully operating the Copy Department when he knew or should have known much would depend upon company policies and the way other departments performed their work. 26 I was impressed with the evidence of Ms. Taylor. She struck me as an honest and fair administrator. She and Skeena went to great lengths to try and meet the demands of Mr. DeRosa. However, they refused to agree to any of his suggestions which they knew from past experience would probably fail. Wherever there is a difference in the evidence between the testimony of Mr. DeRosa and that of Ms. Taylor, I accept her evidence over his. Consequently, I am unable to find that in the pre-hiring telephone conversations Skeena agreed that Mr. DeRosa would be free to implement an administrative system in the Copy Department to his specifications. 27 Left for consideration is the letter of 3 April 1990. The letter does not appear to be a document containing pre-hiring representations outside the actual offer of employment. Rather, it seems to be the offer of employment itself. The letter is somewhat ambiguous because the second sentence in the paragraph qualifies the first. In the first sentence, Skeena offers to give Mr. DeRosa the right to manage the Copy Department \"so that there is a tight control on facilities orders and carts.\" By itself the commitment is vague and uncertain. Nothing in the letter suggests that Mr. DeRosa will have the unfettered authority to implement an administrative system in the Copy Department to his specifications. Finally, the second sentence qualifies the offer in these words: \"I don't anticipate any problems in turning this over to your department.\" 28 What the letter apparently amounts to, is an offer by Skeena to Mr. DeRosa that he could set up a system to his specifications in the Copy Department allowing for tight control of facilities orders and carts, unless unanticipated problems arose. By his conduct Mr. DeRosa accepted the offer and went to work for Skeena. Unanticipated problems did arise when Mr. DeRosa attempted to implement his system. Thus, Skeena had the right to withdraw any commitment it made to Mr. DeRosa about his right to exercise tight control over facilities orders and carts. 29 By itself, the letter might have been grounds for a claim of constructive dismissal if one had been made. But even then, such a claim likely would have failed since the letter does not contain an unqualified promise to Mr. DeRosa that he would be allowed to implement an administrative system in the Copy Department to his specifications. The letter is also consistent with the evidence of Ms. Taylor concerning the contents of the pre-hiring telephone conversations. 30 Given these findings, neither Ms. Taylor nor Skeena made any negligent or fraudulent misrepresentations to Mr. DeRosa. Therefore, it is not necessary to determine whether the defences apply of estoppel by res judicata , and lack of jurisdiction by reason of the collective agreement. As to issue estoppel, see for example: Grewal v. Small et al . (1985), 69 B.C.L.R. 121 (B.C.S.C); Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc . v. Everett (1989), 37 B.C.L.R. (2d) 341 (B.C.C.A.); Evans v. Campbell (1993), 77 B.C.L.R. (2d) 211 (B.C.C.A.), etc. As to lack of jurisdiction, see for example: Queen v. Cognos Inc . (1993), 45 C.C.E.L. 153 (S.C.C.); Ontario (Attorney General) v. Bowie (1993), 1 C.C.E.L. (2d) 190 (Ont. Court of Justice); Steer v. Aerovox (1984), 5 C.C.E.L. 130 (Nova Scotia Supreme Court); Canada Labour Code , s.57, etc. 31 With respect to the counterclaim, counsel did not cite any authority to me that holds the use of the court system by a litigant amounts to an abuse of process giving a remedy in damages. A person who brings an unsuccessful action can be penalized in costs. Apart from exceptional circumstances, costs are the remedy for the successful party, not damages in a counter-suit for abuse of process. 32 Because both the action and the counterclaim are dismissed, my preliminary view is that each side should bear their own costs. But I will hear submissions from counsel on the point if they are unable to agree. JUDGMENT 33 1. The action and the counter-claim are dismissed. 2. Each side will bear their own costs. \"J.C.

JUSTICE LEGGATT THE CORPORATION OF DELTA ) ) RESPONDENT ) ) R. H. Guile counsel for petitioner D.D. McLellan counsel for respondent Date and place of hearing: December 4 and 5, 1990 at Vancouver, B.C. This is an application under the Judicial Review Procedure Act , R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 209. The corporate petitioner, Delsom Estates Ltd., owns approximately 140 acres of land within the Municipality of Delta. It wishes to lease a 6 acre portion of this property, located at 10681 - 84th Avenue, Delta, to the Marlborough College Society for the operation of a private school. This land is presently zoned as RS-3 (family residential), but is designated on the official community plan as \"Commercial: Town Centre, Service, Residential and Marine/Resort\". There is a long history of attempts by the petitioners to obtain the necessary rezoning and permits with regard to this particular property. The Delta Municipal Council has to this date rejected all applications for rezoning and permits. The relationship between petitioners and respondent has been fractious; court proceedings have been initiated several times. Although it is not necessary to review, in detail, the whole history of this property, a brief summary of the recent facts leading to this application are necessary. In early 1988, the petitioners began construction of the Marlborough College without work permit, development permit, temporary use permit, or any other authorization. The petitioner Elsom then applied for a temporary permit. Council decided that they would not entertain further development on the subject lands until the issue of public open space requirements had been resolved. The petitioners then applied for judicial review. On August 30, 1988, MacEachern CJSC, as he then was, declared that all considerations of public park space were irrelevant and that the Council should reconsider the application. The council complied. On September 6, 1988, council refused to grant the petitioners a temporary use permit; on October 24, 1988, it rejected the petitioners' application for rezoning. Again, the petitioners applied for judicial review. On January 18, 1989, Macdonnell J. held that, on the whole, neither decision had been improperly made. The petitioners have appealed the ruling. Shortly afterwards, on March 8, 1989, Mr. Elsom retained a solicitor, William T. Lane, to act as an intermediary between himself and the council, in an attempt to resolve all outstanding differences between them. Mr. Lane entered into negotiations with the council, and eventually an agreement was reached. The plans for the school were agreed upon by both Lane, on behalf of the petitioners, and council. An application for rezoning was then filed with the Municipality. The rezoning was to be approved through the enactment of two bylaws, pursuant to the agreement, the council held first, second and third reading, plus a public hearing on the bylaws. No problems arose. Before fourth and final reading of the bylaws, the petitioners replaced the original plans, which formed the basis of the rezoning application, with a brand new set of plans. The new plans represented a drastic change, as the difference in price indicates; the original building cost was budgeted at $2,000,000.00, whereas the new building would cost only $500,000.00. On November 6, 1989, the council was asked to proceed to a fourth reading of the rezoning bylaws based on plans that it had never considered before. After a short debate, council passed a motion to rescind the bylaws and in effect terminated the process. In support of their application for mandamus, the petitioners have alleged, in an effort to prove its bad faith, a long history of wrong doing on the part of the council. Also, both counsel have argued at length about the powers given to municipalities under the Municipality Act . Under the circumstances, most of the factual and legal arguments are of little application. I agree with the respondent that Macdonnell J. ruled on the same issues of bad faith, denial of natural justice, and irrelevant considerations as they applied to the facts up to October 24, 1988. To that extent, those issues are res judicata. Further, it is clear that it is the November 6, 1989 decision not to proceed with fourth reading that lies at the heart of this application. The main issue is whether the decision was properly made, or whether council should be ordered to proceed with fourth reading. Fortunately, Mr. Elsom had transcripts made of the November 6, 1989 meeting and the reasoning of the council can be fully examined. The petitioner has advanced several grounds for judicial review. First, they allege that irrelevant and extraneous considerations were the basis for the decision not to rezone the property. In particular, the petitioners submit that council based its decision on the availability of public space and on the modular design of the school buildings, both declared irrelevant in the previous proceedings. However, the transcripts of the November 6, 1989 meeting contain no mention of either requirement. Rather, it is clear that council rescinded the bylaws because of an unexpected change in plans. Alderman Jackson summarized the opinion of council thus: As a matter of principle, we dealt with Plan A at public hearing, it was given third reading, it was expedited though first and second, and we are looking at an entire change of plans. And on the that basis, I'm afraid I can't deal with it as a proposal. If I were dealing with the original proposal, we could deal with it at fourth reading or whatgever, but we don't have that before us. (p.9) The main purpose of public readings and public hearings is to give the public an opportunity to respond to the impending legislation. Had the council proceeded to a fourth reading on a new set of plans, it would have nullified this purpose. In fact, the council clearly acted on what they believed to be the best interest of the community. This ground of review must fail. The petitioners further complain that at the meeting of November 6, 1989, Mr. Elsom was not allowed to explain to the council the reason for removing the plans. The following explanation was offered in argument. The original plans had been agreed by the council and Mr. Lane, on behalf of Mr. Elsom, while Mr. Elsom was in England. When Mr. Elsom returned, he reviewed the plans and found them unacceptable. Apparently, he attempted to advise council of both his concerns with respect to the original plans and of the proposed modifications to them. The petitioners submit that council's refusals to hear Mr. Elsom both before and during the November 6, 1989 meeting amounted to a denial of natural justice. Admittedly, in general, the right to be heard is present in all administrative decisions. Under the circumstances, however, council did not act improperly. As pointed out above, the transcripts show that council was concerned about the requirement of public notice, which would not have been met had a fourth reading been held. Whatever reasons Mr. Elsom might have offered to the council, there had been a substantial change in plans. Therefore, even if Mr. Elsom had been allowed to speak, the decision of the council would not have been affected. Its first duty was to the public, not Mr. Elsom. The next ground of complaint is the internal report prepared by the Municipality, which recommended that the rezoning not be approved. This report was presented at the meeting of November 6, 1989, and there was a motion to adopt its recommendations. The petitioners point out that they do not have access to internal reports prior to hearings, and therefore do not have an opportunity to respond in any fashion. The respondent argues that it is standard policy not to release internal reports to the public before the aldermen have a chance to review it. The transcripts of the meeting show that this is a moot point; the rezoning bylaws were rescinded because of the unannounced change in plans, not because of the internal report; thus, I need not decide if council's policy amounts to a denial of natural justice. However, at least prima facie, it appears that Mr. Elsom, and all other applicants for rezoning, are not given an opportunity to answer the case against them. This may well be unacceptable and the council may want to consider changing its policy in order to make the reports available, at least to the parties most directly affected by them. There is evidence that council wants the petitioners to commit themselves to a comprehensive development plan for the surrounding property, also owned by the petitioners. The petitioners argue that development is an irrelevant consideration. This issue was resolved by Macdonnell J. in the previous application: The Delta council has decided that it will not rezone the property in question until it has received more information with respect to the development plans for the surrounding property. In terms of planning, this is a relevant consideration. If the subject property is rezoned to P1 (public use), the surrounding land would need to be zoned and developed in ways which would complement, rather than conflict with, a \"public use area\". (p. 269) The petitioners concede that Delta may have a legitimate basis for considering the adjacent lands with respect to the particular rezoning application, but they submit that this right does not go as far as forcing the petitioners to commit themselves to a comprehensive plan for development of its land holdings. The fact that the petitioners are the owners of several adjacent parcels of land, they insist, should not be allowed to intrude upon a particular application for rezoning. Again, the reasoning of Macdonnell answers the objection. Council has, in effect, decided that it needs more information before it can make a proper determination of the rezoning application. It is not for the Court to weigh the sufficiency of the material before council and impose its opinion as to whether council should rezone or not. Council has the responsibility of deciding whether rezoning is to be allowed or not. The petitioner has no right at law to rezone. The matter is in the discretion of council alone, and it is only accountable to the electorate for its lawful decision. (p. 269) Finally, the petitioners have listed several other acts by the municipality, which they submit prove that the council continue to act in bad faith, singling out the petitioners for inordinately harsh treatment. On the whole, it is apparent that the relationship between petitioners and respondent are strained. However, none of the acts complained of amount to misconduct of such a nature as to justify a judicial review remedy. Accordingly, the petition is dismissed with costs. S.M. LEGGATT, J.

        "text": " CA014412 Vancouver Registry Court of Appeal for British Columbia ORAL REASONS FOR JUDGMENT : BEFORE THE HONOURABLE January 24, 1992 MR. JUSTICE LAMBERT IN CHAMBERS Vancouver, B.C. BETWEEN: ALICE MARY LOUISE DAVIS PLAINTIFF (RESPONDENT) AND: RONALD EDWARD PERKINS DEFENDANT (APPELLANT) L.A. Macdonald appearing for the Appellant C. Marcotte appearing for the Respondent (application for leave to appeal) LAMBERT, J.A.: This is an application for leave to appeal an order for interim maintenance. The circumstances of the parties in their domestic relationship are somewhat unusual and their financial arrangements more unusual still. The application for maintenance is made by Mrs. Davis who is the plaintiff. She has had two children by Mr. Perkins who is the defendant. The children are now 17 years old and 14 years old. She and Mr. Perkins have had a long standing relationship. Mr. Perkins has remained throughout that period married to Mrs. Perkins and throughout that period has lived at the matrimonial home shared by Mr. and Mrs. Perkins. The Perkins have one child who is now 30 years old. The financial affairs of Mr. and Mrs. Perkins and Mr. Perkins' father and Mrs. Davis all involve a series of contracts for the distribution of local and regional newspapers. Those contracts were altered in their form in 1980 or thereabouts when Mr. Perkins was experiencing difficulties with the Income Tax Department and trying to shelter himself from an obligation which might be imposed, he thought wrongfully, on him in relation to income tax. In the course of the intervening years the contracts have remained unusual in their set-up, perhaps influenced by Mr. Perkins' continuing problems with the Income Tax Department. Mrs. Perkins' from her employment, which as I understand it is in the newspaper area, has an income of about $33,000 a year. Mrs. Davis, from a contract for the distribution of the Vancouver Sun, has an income of about $25,000 a year. Before she had that income she was in receipt of Welfare and her two children were from time to time assisted by Welfare payments though Mr. Perkins has from time to time paid money to Mrs. Davis over the course of their relationship, at least since the children were born. It was against these difficult circumstances and in reliance on affidavit evidence that was not entirely explicable that Mr. Justice MacKinnon had to decide the amount of interim maintenance. The interim maintenance order, it seems likely, will be in effect until after November, 1992, because that is the date now set for the hearing of Mr. Perkins' application for an order that he has a trust interest in the house registered in the name of Mrs. Davis. He concedes that if it were established that he had that interest in that property then that property could be used to pay or secure the maintenance payments to the children. Mr. Perkins' position is that he has no assets at all and no income at all from which it could possibly be said that he could pay any amount of maintenance. Mrs. Perkins has announced that she is unwilling to mortgage her interest in the family home further than it is now mortgaged in order to free up funds, or to pay funds out of her own salary, which would ultimately be used, by going from her through Mr. Perkins, for the support of the children. Of course, no order could be made, or at least no order is requested, asking her to pay any such amount. On the other hand if Mr. Perkins has arranged his affairs with his wife so that she has income and he does not, then it is not improper for this Court or the trial court to order that he pay maintenance and it is up to him to obtain the funds to do it. I was referred to the decision of Haigh v. Haigh (1987) 9 R.F.L. (3d) 301. There Mr. Justice Wallace for the Court set out the position that has been set out in many other cases, namely, that this Court should not interfere with the amount of an award of interim maintenance unless it is based on the application of a wrong principle of law, unless it is based on the mis-assessment of the evidence, or unless the amount so ordered is inordinately high or inordinately low. Interim maintenance cases present great difficulties in reassessment on an appeal because the situation of the parties is very often changing from month to month. By the time the appeal comes on for hearing the situation is often different than when the interim order was made. It is impossible to tinker on a monthly basis in the light of constantly changing financial circumstances and all that is recognized when the interim order is set. Two hundred and fifty dollars does not support a teenage child, far from it. The order that was made by Mr. Justice MacKinnon was for maintenance in the amount of $250 per month for each of these two children. I assume that the order would come to an end for the oldest child when that oldest child ceases to be a child entitled to maintenance under the Family Relations Act . There is one final matter that properly influences the decision on whether leave to appeal should be granted. This order was made on the 22 July, 1991. No maintenance of any kind has been paid under the order in the intervening six months. It is a proper factor to take into account in deciding whether to grant leave to appeal to consider whether any payment has been made under the order. If there are good reasons for not making the payment there is a forum in which those reasons could be advanced. It certainly militates against granting leave to appeal that the order has not been complied with in the smallest particular. In my opinion, it cannot be said, in all of the circumstances of this case, that Mr. Justice MacKinnon erred in principle or mis-assessed the facts or made an award that was inordinately high. Indeed, I do not think any argument can be made that has any significant possibility of success to the effect that Mr. Justice MacKinnon erred in principle, mis-assessed the facts, or made an award that was inordinately high. In those circumstances I refuse the application for leave to appeal. \"The Honourable Mr. Justice Lambert\"",

APPELLANTS Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice Taggart The Honourable Mr. Justice Toy The Honourable Madam Justice Proudfoot Lawrence M. Candido counsel for the appellants Frank R. Eadie counsel for the respondent Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British Columbia June 17, 1991 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia January 24, 1992 Written Reasons by: The Honourable Mr. Justice Taggart Concurred in by: The Honourable Mr. Justice Toy The Honourable Madam Justice Proudfoot CA012776 Vancouver Registry Court of Appeal for British Columbia Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation v. Westsea Construction Ltd., Capital Construction Supplies Ltd., West Park Developments Ltd. and View Towers Properties Ltd. REASONS FOR JUDGMENT OF MR. JUSTICE TAGGART: The defendants appeal from a judgment awarding the plaintiff the sum of $149,946.48 paid into court by the defendants to effect the discharge of a mortgage granted by the defendant West Park Developments Ltd. (West Park) to the plaintiff. Of that sum the plaintiff claimed $57,571.23 as a bonus payable for early discharge of the mortgage and $92,375.25 as compound interest. The mortgage was granted on April 23, 1970 to secure a loan of $3,615,358.00 which West Park used to construct a low rental housing project in Victoria. Interest was payable at 6 and 7/8 percent per annum calculated half-yearly not in advance as well after as before maturity. January 1, 1971 was fixed as the interest adjustment date. Thereafter the principal and interest were payable in monthly instalments of $21,142.42 commencing on February 1, 1971 and ending on January 1, 2021. Arrears of principal and interest were to bear compound interest at 6 and 7/8 percent. If the mortgagor was not in default then on the fifteenth anniversary of the interest adjustment date, or thereafter on any monthly instalment payment date, it could pay the whole or any part of the principal and interest owing. A bonus of three months interest on the amount then owing was charged for the privilege of prepaying. On June 1, 1970 the parties entered into an operating agreement which set out the basis upon which the mortgage would be managed. The agreement confirmed the obligation of the mortgagor to make payment of principal and interest; and its entitlement to prepay the amount due for principal and interest on and after the fifteenth anniversary of the interest adjustment date. West Park transferred title to the property to Westsea Construction Ltd. (Westsea) which, as were the other defendants, was owned or controlled by one man. Nothing appears to turn on the inter-corporate relationships of the defendants. Westsea discharged its obligation to make the monthly mortgage payments by sending the plaintiff before the end of each year twelve post-dated cheques for the payments to be made in the following year. The fifteenth anniversary of the interest adjustment date fell on January 1, 1986. Before the end of 1985 Westsea sent the plaintiff twelve post-dated cheques for the 1986 mortgage payments. On October 9, 1986 the plaintiff wrote Westsea saying that the fifteen year \"lock-in\" period of the mortgage had expired on October 1, 1986; that because of defaults in the operating agreement the balance owing under the mortgage was due; and demanding payment of $3,400,284.45 which was said to be the amount due on October 15, 1986 with a per diem of $629.73 thereafter. That letter was followed by one of November 20, 1986 advising Westsea its twelve post-dated cheques for 1986 would be used up in December and asking for a new series of post-dated cheques. Westsea sent the plaintiff twelve post-dated cheques for 1987. On January 5, 1987 the plaintiff's solicitors returned the twelve cheques for 1987; advised Westsea the plaintiff was no longer accepting post-dated cheques; and suggested Westsea discuss with Mr. Kilner of the plaintiff's Vancouver office arrangements for repayment of the mortgage. Nothing further appears to have happened until April 14, 1987 when the plaintiff wrote to West Park (misstating its name as West Part) advising the latter of the state of the mortgage account which was said to be in arrears to the extent of $63,427.26. That was the amount of the January, February and March 1987 payments. Westsea sent the plaintiff three cheques each in the amount of $21,142.42 to pay the arrears. The plaintiff did not cash the cheques but retained possession of them. A much longer interval of silence ensued. Finally on February 27, 1990 the plaintiff began this action alleging breaches of the operating agreement and seeking relief of various kinds including an order requiring West Park to comply with the provisions of the operating agreement. On March 1, 1990 Westsea wrote the plaintiff saying it wished to pay out the mortgage and asking for a payout statement. No reply was received so on March 8th the solicitors for Westsea sent the solicitors for the plaintiff a bank draft for $4,135,975.91. That sum was calculated in accordance with the terms of the plaintiff's letter of October 9, 1986. The draft was sent in final payment of any amount owing on the mortgage and on condition that Westsea be provided with a registrable discharge of the mortgage. The letter and draft were returned and two further efforts to pay out the mortgage were rebuffed. There followed an exchange of correspondence which resulted in the mortgage being paid off and the sum of $149,946.48 being paid into court by Westsea. That sum is made up of $57,571.23 claimed by the plaintiff for the three months bonus and $92,375.25 claimed for compound interest. Since each party claimed the entire sum the dispute was referred to a judge in chambers for resolution. The judge reviewed the relevant authorities including Brown v. Cole (1845), 14 Sim. 427, 60 E.R. 424; Bovill v. Endle , [1896] 1 Ch. 648 (Ch.D.); Smith v. Smith , [1891] 3 Ch. 550 (Ch.D.); Browne v. Lockhart (1840), 10 Sim. 420, 59 E.R. 678; Cameo Developments Ltd. v. National Life Assurance Company of Canada (1984), 56 B.C.L.R. 363 (C.A.); Prudential Insurance Company of America v. Hollyburn Properties (Alberta) Ltd. (1985), 58 B.C.L.R. 211 (C.A.); Re Shankman and Mutual Life Ass. Co. (1986), 21 D.L.R. (4th) 131 (Ont. C.A.); and Chang v. Brown (1977), 2 B.C.L.R. 65 (S.C.). As he did before the chambers judge, counsel for the defendants urged us to rely on the October 1986 demand by the plaintiff for payment of the amount due on the mortgage. He argued that the authorities precluded the plaintiff from relying on the provisions of the operating agreement relating to the payment of a bonus. In rejecting that argument the judge said: The demand was made back in October, 1986. A mortgagor seeking to exercise an equitable right should have \"accepted\" that demand long before the spring of 1990. C.M.H.C. never took any effective steps to enforce the demand and by passage of time it simply withered away; alternatively, it was, if still in existence, extinguished by the commencement of this action on February 27, 1990 which clearly is not a step to compel a payment of the whole of the mortgage debt but to protect the security. Counsel relied on Edmondson v. Copland , [1911] 2 Ch. 301 (Ch. D.), to justify the very long delay by Westsea in raising as a defence the effect of the obvious mistake by the plaintiff in making the demand. I do not think that case assists the defendants. There was no error in the conclusion of the chambers judge that in the circumstances of this case the plaintiff is entitled to claim the three months bonus. The defendants challenged the decision of the judge that the plaintiff was entitled to compound interest contending that Westsea made an appropriate tender to the plaintiff when it sent the plaintiff the twelve post-dated cheques in October 1986. On this aspect the judge said: In the matter of the compound interest Mr. Candido submits that the defendant was never at any time in arrears and, therefore, C.M.H.C. is not entitled to compound interest pursuant to clause 6. He says that when in reply to C.M.H.C.'s letter of November 20, 1986 Westsea sent C.M.H.C. twelve cheques for the year 1987 there was a good tender by Westsea and the rule is clear that where a debtor is obliged to pay a specific sum of money to a creditor and the debtor makes a valid tender which the creditor unjustifiably refuses, although the debt remains the tender bars any claim for interest or damages after the tender. He says that here the defendants have paid the ordinary interest but because of the tender cannot be compelled to pay the compound interest. I have no hesitation in finding that there was no tender by the defendants. What they did was attempt to take advantage of what was clearly a lack of communication between the several departments of C.M.H.C. The letter of January 5, 1987 from C.M.H.C.'s solicitors to Westsea made it very clear what the position of C.M.H.C. was. Furthermore if, as the defendants have maintained, there was made by C.M.H.C. in October, 1986 a demand for payment of the whole, the sending of twelve post-dated cheques for the year 1987 is not a tender in reply to that demand. In any event for a plea of tender to be successful in barring a creditor from entitlement to interest, there must be evidence that the debtor set aside the tendered sum and that set aside sum remains ready for payment at any time ( Barratt v. Gough Thomas (1951), 2 All E.R. 48). There was no evidence before me that any sum or sums were ever set aside by the plaintiffs [sic: defendants]. The plea of tender fails and I hold that C.M.H.C. is entitled to payment by way of compound interest of the sum of $92,375.35 [sic: $92,375.25]. Again I see no error on the part of the judge. On the contrary I think he reached the only conclusion open to him on the evidence before him. Westsea raised two subsidiary issues concerning the burden of proof and legal as opposed to equitable remedies. The burden of proof issue arises because the judge referred to it when dealing with the defendants' submissions with respect to bonus. As I read his reasons the judge used the expression \"burden of proof\" in relation to the defendants only in the sense that he who asserts a proposition must sustain it. The judge was clearly of the view the defendants had not met that test and I agree they did not. The judge referred to the equitable right which the defendants sought to enforce in the first passage from his judgment set out above. I agree with the submission of counsel for the plaintiff that in essence what the defendants were asserting was their equitable right to redeem their title. I can find no error in what the judge said. The defendants' submissions based on the Interest Act were abandoned. In my opinion the remaining submissions fail for the reasons I have stated and for the reasons given by the chambers judge with which I agree. I would dismiss the appeal. \"THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE TAGGART\" I AGREE: \"THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE TOY\" I AGREE: \"THE HONOURABLE MADAM JUSTICE PROUDFOOT\"",

        "text": "Citation: Borecky v. Borecky Date: 20000111 2000 BCSC 33 Docket: D110467 Registry: Vancouver IN THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA BETWEEN: ISABELLE DIANE BORECKY PLAINTIFF AND: GARY WILLIAM BORECKY DEFENDANT REASONS FOR JUDGMENT OF THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE HOOD Counsel for the Plaintiff: J. Bennett Counsel for the Defendant: D. Tupper Date and Place of Hearing: January 5 & 6, 2000 Vancouver, B.C. [1] In March 1999 I gave oral reasons for judgment at the end of the trial in this proceedings. I ordered the plaintiff mother to return the child, Jessie, from Ontario to reside in the Burnaby area, an area advantageous to all. I also ordered joint custody of the child, with her primary place of residence being with the plaintiff in the area referred to. I also ordered child maintenance pursuant to The Federal Child Support Guidelines, having fixed the defendant's income at $32,000.00, as well as spousal maintenance in the amount of $200.00 for one year, although not sought by the plaintiff. [2] During the trial the evidence was that it was likely that the defendant's income would increase in the near future as he became more established and more work became available. It was also understood that the plaintiff was going to need assistance while seeking employment, and getting back on her feet and so on; that she would have to pay daycare and other expenses which could not be dealt with at that time. [3] At trial the defendant said, in effect, that he would help the plaintiff re-establish herself in the Burnaby area, physically as well as financially, and I took him at his word. According to the plaintiff he did not keep it. The evidence of the parties in this, and other areas, clashes head-on and I do not propose to deal with it in these proceedings. However, I do observe that the plaintiff has re-established herself without assistance from the defendant. After returning to the Vancouver area she worked at two or three jobs, before landing a permanent job with Continuing Legal Education in August 1999. Her 1999 income was $24,800.00 which included monies from a number of sources including pension plan monies which the defendant was ordered to pay or transfer to her in the earlier proceedings. Her 2000 income from employment is expected to be $28,000.00. [4] When she returned to Vancouver the plaintiff did not reside in the Burnaby area as directed. However, she has now agreed to do so, and I need not deal with the reasons why she chose to reside in Richmond. It is understood that she will move to Burnaby in the summer, to an area reasonably close to the defendant's residence so as to accommodate access and other matters beneficial to the child. In this regard counsel will work out a brief guideline pertaining to the defendant's attendance at the plaintiff's residence, such as prior notice, times and so on. [5] I turn to the relief sought by the plaintiff in her notice of motion. As regards items #1 and #2, her divorce has been granted and the $73.36 in arrears has been paid. [6] As to item #3, she seeks an order pursuant to s.17 of The Divorce Act , and The Federal Child Support Guidelines , that the child support provisions of my order of March 19, 1999 in these proceedings be varied. The basis is that there has been a substantial increase in the defendant's income since April 1999, constituting a material change in circumstances. A second material change is also asserted in that she has required daycare and related services since May 1999. I am satisfied that the plaintiff requires full-time daycare, with the certainty which it will provide, given the uncertainty of the defendant's work schedule. I am also satisfied that the defendant must pay increased child support, and a proportionate share of the costs of these services, whether they are looked upon as material changes in circumstances or simply known obligations which the Court could not deal with at the time of the March 19, 1999 order, and therefore were left to be dealt with at a later date. The daycare and related costs, of course, are properly s.7 expenses. [7] I accept the figures set out in Ms. Bennett's hand-up, which I assume was exhibited in the proceedings, as adjusted a bit by both counsel, and, I believe, agreed to. The Federal Child Support Guideline table amount of child support to be paid commencing January 1, 2000, is $396.00 per month. [8] The defendant's income for 2000 will be $46,372.00. The plaintiff's income will be $28,000.00. The defendant's proportionate share of Jessie's health care premium of $72.00 is 63% or $45.00. His similar proportionate share of the child care costs of $565.00 is $356.00. He therefore will pay, commencing January 1, 2000, the further sum of $401.00, being his proportionate share of the s.7 expenses. [9] The plaintiff also seeks an order varying the March 19, 1999 order for child support retro-active to May 1, 1999, the point in time when the changes referred to occurred, that is, when the defendant's income was increased and the plaintiff commenced to incur daycare and related expenses. Particulars of this claim are set out in pg 2 of Ms. Bennett's hand-up as follows: Table amount differential: $396-$280=116x8 months = $ 928 Health Care premiums: $72x65%=$47x4 months = $ 188 Child care: $262 deposit to Angels Daycare $ 262 $525x8 months to Angels Daycare $4,200 Less daycare subsidy of $354x5 months <1,770> $40 x 4 months to care between daycare and school $ 160 $25 x 2 to child care when Angels Daycare closed $ 50 $2,902x65% $1,886 $3,002 Table amount differential: $396-$280=116x8 months = $ 928 Health Care premiums: $72x65%=$47x4 months = $ 188 Child care: $262 deposit to Angels Daycare $ 262 $525x8 months to Angels Daycare $4,200 Less daycare subsidy of $354x5 months <1,770> $40 x 4 months to care between daycare and school $ 160 $25 x 2 to child care when Angels Daycare closed $ 50 $2,902x65% $1,886 $3,002 The proportionate share of 65% is based on the plaintiff's 1999 income being $24,800.00 and the defendant's income being $46,372.00. [10] In my opinion the defendant's obligation to pay these monies, and Jessie's entitlement to them, arose on or about May 1, 1999. I do not think it necessary to deal with the evidence as to why the defendant did not advise the plaintiff of the increase in his income, or why he did not assist her by increasing the monthly child support payment and, in particular, by paying a proportionate share of the child care costs. During at least a portion of this period the plaintiff had very little income and had to rely on monies borrowed from relatives, as well as a portion of the RRSP monies to which I have referred. [11] There is authority for the retroactive child maintenance order sought, which order is discretionary. See the decision of the Court of Appeal in L.S. v. E.P. (1999), B.C.C.A. 393. There at pg. 15 Madam Justice Rowles, speaking for the Court, commences her discussion of the various factors, both positive and negative, which the Courts have considered or emphasised when deciding whether to exercise the discretion and make the order. [12] In the case at Bar the plaintiff has established most of the factors militating in favour of the order, and none of those militating against the order appears to be present. For example, there was and is a need on the part of the child and a corresponding ability on the part of the defendant to pay. There is some blameworthy conduct on the part of the defendant in the circumstances in failing to meet his known obligations when they arose, and in failing to disclose the increase in his income when declaring his financial situation. And the plaintiff was forced to encroach on her capital and to incur debt, which would not have been necessary had the support been forthcoming from the defendant. [13] This is not a case of inexcusably delayed or stale claims, or of an unreasonable burden being placed on the defendant. He has always known of these obligations, and any delay in meeting them, which he knew would create hardship for the child and the plaintiff, must be attributed to him. In my view, in the circumstances of the case, even if the payment of the monies if ordered to be paid would create a hardship on the defendant, which I do not believe is the case, he should not be entitled to benefit from his deliberate conduct and then plead hardship at the expense of his child and the custodial mother. Reasonableness and fairness are the key factors in such circumstances. [14] In summary, while some of the factors discussed by Madam Justice Rowles may be determinative in a given case, it is my opinion in the case at Bar that there are no factors alone or combined which militate against the order. On the contrary, the facts clearly support the exercise of the discretion in favour of the plaintiff and the child. I therefore conclude that the defendant must pay the $3,002.00 to the plaintiff. [15] The plaintiff also seeks in her Notice of Motion an order for specified access for the defendant, in conjunction with an order that she may move the habitual residence of Jessie to the Province of Ontario. Both matters, items #4 and #5, have been adjourned and it is not necessary for me to deal with the conflicting affidavit evidence pertaining to them. Obviously such matters cannot be resolved by way of a summary proceeding, but will require testimony of the parties and perhaps others, if they are to proceed. [16] I observe also that notwithstanding their love for Jessie, it appears that there is still much animosity between the parties. The defendant asserts that the plaintiff continues with her former conduct which I commented on in my earlier reasons. He says that she will not co-operate. She continues to disrupt and dominate his telephone calls with Jessie, and to make everything difficult, including access, all for the stated purpose of obtaining court approval for her to take Jessie back to Ontario to reside. The plaintiff, of course, denies these assertions. She alleges that it is he who will not co-operate with or help her, and who makes matters difficult. [17] It is unfortunate for Jessie that this state of affairs has been allowed to continue. She is the one who will pay its price. The parties have already been warned that their conduct may well reflect their custodial and access rights in the future. [18] There are two remaining additional matters. First the plaintiff requests that I direct the defendant to make his best efforts to obtain airline tickets from his father for Jessie when the plaintiff wishes to visit her relatives in the east. She does not seek an order that he pay any portion of such costs. I understand that the defendant is willing to make his best efforts for tickets for Jessie, and I need not deal with the matter further. [19] Finally, the plaintiff seeks an order that the child maintenance be secured by the defendant obtaining a life insurance policy. There is no evidentiary basis before me to support such an order and I decline to make it. [20] The plaintiff will have her costs. \"Hood, J.\" Vancouver, B.C. January 11, 2000",

Cr\u00e8me De La Crumb Bakeshop & Catering Ltd.,   2020 BCSC 42 Date: 20200114 Docket: S159510 Registry:  Vancouver Between: Sam Kwon Woo, also  known as Sam Woo, by his litigation Guardian Ok Yon Woo Plaintiff And Cr\u00e8me De La Crumb  Bakeshop & Catering Ltd. Defendant Before:  The Honourable Mr. Justice Skolrood Supplementary Reasons for Judgment (to   Woo v. Cr\u00e8me De La Crumb Bakeshop & Catering Ltd. , 2019 BCSC 1752) Counsel for the Plaintiff: M. Dorner    R.K. Buchanan Counsel for the Defendant: A. Eged    J. Skinnider, Articled Student Place and Date of Trial/Hearing: Vancouver, B.C. December 2, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, B.C. January 14, 2020   [1]     On October 15, 2019, I issued reasons for judgment in this matter, which  are indexed at 2019 BCSC 1752. The action arose out of an incident that  occurred on February 17, 2015, when the plaintiff fell from a ladder while  working at premises leased by the defendant, resulting in catastrophic  injuries. [2]     I awarded the plaintiff a total of $340,000 in damages, but then reduced  that amount by 50% to reflect an equal apportionment of liability between the  plaintiff and the defendant. [3]     In addition to the claim for damages, the plaintiff advanced a claim  under the  Health Care Costs Recovery Act , S.B.C. 2008, c. 27 [ HCCRA ],  and sought to introduce into evidence a Minister\u2019s certificate issued under  that Act (the \u201cMinister\u2019s Certificate\u201d). The defendant objected and it was  agreed that consideration of this issue would be deferred until after the  release of the above-mentioned reasons. [4]     On December 2, 2019, the parties appeared before me to deal with the  HCCRA   claim. [5]     The relevant provisions of the  HCCRA  include the following: Definitions 1   In  this Act: \u2026 \" future cost of health care services \"  means the present value of the estimated  total cost of all health care services that are provided, or are reasonably  expected to be provided, to a beneficiary as a direct or indirect result of a  personal injury described in section 2 after the date of settlement or, if  there is no settlement, after the first day of trial; \u2026 \" health care services claim \" , in relation to personal injury suffered by  a beneficiary, means a claim for the recovery of the past and future costs of  health care services attributable to that personal injury; \" past cost of health care services \"  means the total cost of all health care  services provided to a beneficiary as a direct or indirect result of a personal  injury described in section 2, including those services provided up to and including  the date of settlement or, if there is no settlement, the first day of trial; \u2026 Obligation to claim 3   (1)  If, in the beneficiary's own name or as a member of a class of persons under  the  Class Proceedings Act , a beneficiary referred to in section 2  (1)  [beneficiary's right to recover]  of this Act or the  beneficiary's personal or other legal representative commences a legal  proceeding against a person alleged to be the wrongdoer for damages arising  from or related to the beneficiary's personal injury or death, the beneficiary  or the beneficiary's personal or other legal representative must include a  health care services claim in that legal proceeding. \u2026 Minister's certificates 16   (1)  A certificate (a) purporting  to have been issued by or on behalf of the minister for the purposes of (i) a health  care services claim, or (ii) recovery  under section 13 (5)  [settlement of claims] , and (b) setting out  the health care services that have been received by a beneficiary or class of  beneficiaries and the health care services that a beneficiary or class of  beneficiaries will likely receive in the future for personal injuries suffered  as a result of the negligence or wrongful act or omission of a wrongdoer, is proof of those health care  services. (2) A certificate (a) purporting  to have been issued by or on behalf of the minister for the purposes of (i) a health  care services claim, or (ii) recovery  under section 13 (5)  [settlement of claims] , and (b) setting out  the past cost of health care services, the future cost of health care services,  or both, attributable to personal injury suffered by a beneficiary or a class  of beneficiaries, is conclusive proof of the past cost of health care  services, the future cost of health care services, or both, as the case may be. [6]     There has been minimal consideration of the  HCCRA  in the case law,  in particular s. 16. One notable exception is  MacEachern v. Rennie , 2009  BCSC 652, in which Mr. Justice Ehrcke examined the statute in some detail in  the context of an application by the plaintiff to amend the statement of claim  to add a claim under the  HCCRA . The application was brought shortly  after the statute was proclaimed in force on April 1, 2009, and after the trial  had commenced.  [7]     Justice Ehrcke denied the application to amend. In doing so, he  considered the meaning to be given to s. 16 of the statute: [24]   \u2026  Counsel for the plaintiff submits that the Minister's certificate is  conclusive proof of the facts contained in it and is therefore not rebuttable. Consequently,  in the plaintiff's submission, it would be pointless for the defendants to lead  evidence or cross-examine the plaintiff's witnesses about the health care costs  since that evidence or cross-examination could not, in law, have any effect in  challenging the health care costs as set out in the Minister's certificate. [25]  I do not  agree with the plaintiff's interpretation of s. 16 of the [ HCCRA ]. That  section sets out two different kinds of certificate evidence. Under  s. 16(1) the Minister may file a certificate setting out the health care  services that have been received by the beneficiary, and in the words of the  section, that certificate \"is proof of those health care services.\" [26]  Section  16(2) is worded differently. Under s. 16(2), the Minister may file a  certificate setting out the past cost of health care services and that  certificate is \"conclusive proof of the past cost of health care  services....\" [27]   The word \"conclusive\" is used only in the second of the  two subsections. Clearly the legislature intended there to be a significant  difference between them. Section 16(1) creates a rebuttable presumption, while  the presumption in s. 16(2) is irrebuttable. This interpretation is  supported by s. 24 of the  Interpretation Act , R.S.B.C. 1996  c. 238 which provides: 24. If an enactment provides  that a document is evidence or proof of a fact, unless the context indicates  that the document is conclusive evidence, the document is admissible in  evidence in any proceeding, and the fact is deemed to be established in the absence  of any evidence to the contrary. [28]  Notwithstanding the filing of a certificate under s. 16(1) of  the  Act , therefore, it is open to the defendants to contest whether all  the health care services claimed in the Minister's certificate are attributable  to the accident. In this case the defendants would argue that a portion of the  plaintiff's health care costs between the time of the accident and the  commencement of the trial are attributable to circumstances or conditions that  pre-existed the accident. [8]     Justice Ehrcke held that the plaintiff\u2019s application  was brought too late in the trial and therefore prejudiced the defendants by  compromising their right to cross-examine the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses and to lead  evidence in respect of the  HCCRA  claim (at para. 31). [9]     The Minister\u2019s Certificate is a relatively short document which I  reproduce in its entirety: Whereas Section 16 of the [ HCCRA ]permits the Minister,  or a person acting on behalf of the Minister, to issue certificates setting  out:  (a)   the health care  services that have been received by a beneficiary or class of beneficiaries and  the health care services that a beneficiary or class of beneficiaries will  likely receive in the future for personal injuries suffered as a result of the  negligence or wrongful act or omission of a wrongdoer; and (b)   the past cost of  health care services, the future cost of health care services, or both,  attributable to personal injury suffered by a beneficiary or a class of  beneficiaries. Therefore the undersigned Brenda Rafter, acting on behalf of  the Minister pursuant to Section 16 of the [ HCCRA ], hereby certifies  that Appendix A attached to this Certificate sets out the health care services  claim for  Sam Woo , \u2026, for personal injuries suffered as a result of the  negligence or wrongful act or omission of a wrongdoer on or about  2015/02/17 . The health care services and the costs of the health care  services, as outlined in Appendix A, are complete as of the date of this  certificate, and total  $801,170.12 . [Bold emphasis in original.] [10]     Appendix \u201cA\u201d attached to the Minister\u2019s Certificate comprises a summary  page setting out the total costs for various categories of health care services  and then an itemized computer printout of specific services and the associated  cost. [11]     The original Minister\u2019s Certificate is dated May 9, 2019. Notably, after  the trial but before this hearing, a new certificate dated November 13, 2019,  was produced (the \u201cRevised Certificate\u201d). It has identical wording to the  original Minister\u2019s Certificate, but the total cost figure has increased to  $1,239,420.46. According to the plaintiff, the Revised Certificate includes  some pre-trial services that had been omitted from the original Minister\u2019s  Certificate and also includes a minor amount for costs incurred since January 2019. [12]     The defendant objects to the Minister\u2019s Certificate on the basis that: a)   It does not  comply with s. 16 of the  HCCRA  which requires two certificates, one under  s. 16(1), setting out the health care services received by a beneficiary and a  second under s. 16(2), setting out the past and future costs of health care  services attributable to a personal injury suffered by the beneficiary; b)   It does not  contain the language required by s. 16(1) specifically setting out the health  care services received by a beneficiary, i.e. the plaintiff. Instead, the  Minister\u2019s Certificate purports to set out the \u201chealth care services claim\u201d for  the plaintiff; and c)   It  similarly does not contain the language required by s. 16(2) certifying the  past and future costs of health care services attributable to a personal injury  suffered by a beneficiary. Rather, it purports to certify that the \u201chealth care  services and the costs of the health care services, \u2026, are complete\u201d. [13]     The defendant submits that these omissions and errors in the Minister\u2019s  Certificate render it inadmissible. In support of their position, the defendant  relies on a number of criminal and quasi-criminal law cases in which courts  have rejected evidentiary certificates, for example breath sample certificates,  that did not strictly comply with the governing legislation:  The Queen v.  Noble , [1978] 1 S.C.R. 632 at 638-39;  R. v. Taylor  (1985), 38 M.V.R.  263 at 267-69 (B.C.C.A);  R. v. Paruk  (1999), 49 M.V.R. (3d) 309 at  paras. 36, 58 (B.C.S.C.).  [14]     The plaintiff submits that s. 16 of the  HCCRA  does not prescribe  a particular form for a certificate nor does it require that there be two  separate certificates under ss. 16(1) and (2). Further, the plaintiff submits  that the facts and information required by s. 16 are in fact set out in the  Minister\u2019s Certificate when the language of the certificate is read in  conjunction with the definitions contained in the  HCCRA . For example,  while the Minister\u2019s Certificate refers to the \u201chealth care services claim\u201d, that  phrase is defined in s. 1 as follows: \u2026 in relation to personal injury  suffered by a beneficiary, means a claim for the recovery of the past and  future costs of health care services attributable to that personal injury. [15]     The plaintiff also relies on the definitions of \u201cpast cost of health  care services\u201d and \u201cfuture cost of health care services\u201d in s. 1, which are  reproduced at para. 5 above. [16]     The plaintiff submits that when read in its entirety and in light of the  statutory definitions, the Minister\u2019s Certificate contains all of the  information required by ss. 16(1) and (2) of the  HCCRA . [17]     The defendant\u2019s first objection to the Minister\u2019s Certificate is again  that s. 16 of the  HCCRA  requires two separate and distinct certificates.  In support of this position, the defendant points to the fact that s. 16 is  titled \u201cMinister\u2019s certificates\u201d and that, as found by Ehrcke J. in  MacEachern ,  ss. 16(1) and (2) clearly deal with different types of information. The  defendant also contrasts the language of s. 16 with that used in similar  statutes in other provinces, for example the Alberta  Crown\u2019s Right of  Recovery Act , S.A. 2009, c. C-35, and the Manitoba  Health Services  Insurance Act , C.C.S.M., c. H35. The relevant sections of both of those  statutes refer to \u201cone or more\u201d certificates being issued in respect of health  services received by a beneficiary and the cost of those services (Alberta  Act ,  s. 9(1); Manitoba  Act , s. 97(4)). [18]     I do not agree that s. 16 of the  HCCRA  requires two separate  certificates. While ss. 16(1) and (2) again deal with two different types of  information, the sections do not specify that separate certificates are  necessary. Contrary to the submission of the defendant, Ehrcke J. in  MacEachern   did not find that two certificates are required. Rather, as he noted at para. 25,  s. 16 \u201csets out two different kinds of certificate  evidence \u201d (emphasis  added). The requirement is one of substance rather than form. In my view, s. 16  does not prohibit the Minister or his/her designate from including both types  of evidence in a single certificate. [19]     It follows that I do not accept the defendant\u2019s submission that the  Minister\u2019s Certificate is non-compliant with s. 16 of the  HCCRA . The  authorities they cite for the consequences of non-compliance, largely drawn  from the criminal law context, therefore have no application. [20]     The defendant also objects to the Minister\u2019s Certificate on the basis  that it does not contain the information or facts required by ss. 16(1) and  (2). In considering this objection, it is useful to note again what the two  sections require: a)   Section 16(1)  deals with health care services received, or likely to be received in the  future, by a beneficiary as a result of a wrongful act. The certificate creates  a rebuttable presumption that the listed services are attributable to the  wrongful act ( MacEachern  para. 27): b)   Section 16(2)  deals with the costs of the past and future health care services attributable  to the wrongful act and the certificate constitutes conclusive, irrebuttable,  proof of those costs ( MacEachern  at para. 27). [21]     The two different types of information are dealt with separately in s.  16 for good reason. With respect to the health care services addressed in s.  16(1), it is conceivable that a defendant might take issue with whether a  specific service is in fact attributable to the wrongful act in issue, or is  the result of a separate and unrelated cause. Such disputes regularly arise in  the context of special damages claims and claims for cost of future care in  personal injury actions. For this reason, the presumption created by a  certificate issued pursuant to s. 16(1) may be rebutted by evidence to the  contrary. [22]     Information concerning the costs of health care services, which is  addressed in s. 16(2), is of a different nature. As can be seen in the appendix  attached to the Minister\u2019s Certificate, costs are attributed to each specific  health care service provided by an identified health care practitioner. While  there is no evidence on this point, it can fairly be assumed that these costs  are set pursuant to established tariffs and there is little room for debate  about the accuracy of the costs. For this reason, a certificate issued pursuant  to s. 16(2) is deemed to be conclusive proof of the costs. [23]     Returning to the Minister\u2019s Certificate here, I agree with the defendant  that the language used does not track directly with the wording of ss. 16(1)  and (2). It is not clear why that is as it would be relatively straight forward  to simply provide the information in the manner contemplated by ss. 16(1) and  (2) and in the language used therein. [24]     That said, I am satisfied that the somewhat unartfully drafted  Minister\u2019s Certificate nonetheless conveys the information required by ss.  16(1) and (2). As noted, the first paragraph of the Minister\u2019 s Certificate,  after the preamble, certifies that Appendix \u201cA\u201d to the certificate sets out the  \u201chealth care services claim\u201d for the plaintiff for \u201cpersonal injuries suffered  as a result of the negligence or wrongful act or omission of a wrongdoer on or  about 2015/02/17\u201d (emphasis removed). [25]     Again, \u201chealth care services claim\u201d is defined to mean \u201ca claim for the  recovery of the past and future costs of health care services attributable to  [the specified] personal injury\u201d. The definitions of \u201cpast cost of health care  services\u201d and \u201cfuture cost of health care services\u201d make it clear that the  specified costs are the costs of the health care services attributable to the  personal injury. Further, Appendix \u201cA\u201d to the Minister\u2019s Certificate, which  sets out the various health care services and the associated costs, clearly  identifies the plaintiff as the beneficiary as well as the date of the subject  personal injury. In my view, it is clear to anyone reading the Minister\u2019s  Certificate that it identifies the health care services received by the plaintiff  in respect of the personal injuries that were the subject of this litigation  and the costs of those services, i.e. the information required by ss. 16(1) and  (2). [26]     The defendant seeks to distinguish between a \u201cclaim\u201d for recovery of  health care costs, which is what it says is set out in the Minister\u2019s  Certificate, and a certification that the health care services were received by  the plaintiff, which is what is required under s. 16(1). The defendant submits  that the former is in the nature of a pleading whereas the latter is a material  statement of fact. [27]     In the context of the  HCCRA  and the Minister\u2019s Certificate, this  is a distinction without a difference. Under the  HCCRA , the only claim  that may be advanced, either by the beneficiary (ss. 2 and 3) or by the  government (ss. 7 and 8), is for recovery of the costs of health care services received  by the beneficiary that are attributable to a wrongful act. The intent of a certificate  issued under s. 16 is to identify both the relevant services and the associated  costs. By listing the health care services and the costs in the appendix to the  certificate, the Minister or his/her designate is stating the necessary  material facts. Again, as I noted in para. 25 above, this should be clear to  anyone reading the Minister\u2019s Certificate. [28]     I find that the Minister\u2019s Certificate complies with s. 16 of the  HCCRA   and is therefore admissible. [29]     At the conclusion of the hearing, I indicated that the issue of the  admissibility of the Revised Certificate would be deferred until after I  released these reasons. The parties may make arrangements through Supreme Court  Scheduling for a further appearance to address this issue as well as any other  outstanding matters. \u201cSkolrood  J.\u201d",

        "text": "COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA Citation: Wang v. Shao,   2019 BCCA 52 Date: 20190204 Docket: CA45217 Between: Mei Zhen Wang Appellant (Plaintiff) And Feng Yun Shao also  known Shao Feng Yun also known as Amy  Barsha Washington Respondent (Defendant) Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice Hunter (In Chambers) On appeal from: An  order of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, dated   March 9, 2018 ( Wang v. Shao , 2018 BCSC 377, Vancouver Docket S101156). Oral Reasons for Judgment Counsel for the Appellant: R.V. Wickett, Q.C. E. Dvorak, Articled   Student Counsel for the Respondent: M. Azevedo Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British   Columbia February 4, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British   Columbia February 4, 2019   Summary: The respondent applies for  security for costs of the trial and the appeal. The notice of appeal was filed  on April 6, 2018. Appeal books and factums have been filed. The appeal is set  for hearing March 7, 2019. Held: Application dismissed. In light of the delay  in bringing this application and the proximity of the scheduled date for  hearing the appeal, the interests of justice do not support an order for  security for costs. [1]     HUNTER J.A. : The respondent applies for security for costs of the  appeal and the trial. [2]     The nature of the underlying litigation was described by the trial judge  in the opening paragraph of his judgment (indexed at 2018 BCSC 377): [1] This case concerns the  collapsed sale of a Shaughnessy luxury home. The question at the core of this  dispute is whether the failure of the vendor to disclose the unsolved murder of  an occupant of the property, which occurred almost 2 years before the sale,  entitled the buyer to refuse to complete the purchase, and to recover her  deposit. [3]     The trial judge concluded that it did. He held that the respondent had  been induced to enter into the contract for the purchase of the property by a  fraudulent misrepresentation by the appellant, and was entitled to rescind the  contract and recover her deposit.  [4]     The trial judgment was pronounced on March 9, 2018. The appellant filed  a notice of appeal on April 6, 2018. The transcript and appeal record were  filed on June 29, 2018. The appellant filed her appeal book and factum on  August 13, 2018, and the respondent filed her factum on September 26, 2018. A  certificate of readiness was filed on November 28, 2018 and the appeal is now  scheduled to be heard on March 7, 2019, 31 days from today. [5]     The basis for the application is that the appellant resides in China and  does not appear to have any assets in British Columbia that would be exigible  to pay costs if the appeal is unsuccessful. [6]     The practice of this Court when security for costs is ordered is well  settled. The appellant will be given some time to post the costs, normally 30  days. The appeal is stayed until costs are posted. If costs are not posted by  the specified date, a justice may dismiss the appeal as abandoned, pursuant to  s. 24(2) of the  Court of Appeal Act , R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 77.  [7]     The considerations that are relevant to the decision to order security  for costs to be posted are also well settled. This Court summarized them in  Ellis  v. Denman Island Local Trust Committee , 2016 BCCA 135, in these terms: [7] In  Creative Salmon Company Ltd. v. Staniford ,  2007 BCCA 285 (in Chambers), Lowry J.A. provided a concise statement of the  relevant criteria on an application for security for costs of the appeal: [9] The jurisdiction to  order security for costs of an appeal is found in s. 24 of the  Court of  Appeal Act , R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 77. The appellant against which such an  order is sought bears the onus of showing why security should not be required:    Kedia v. Shandro Dixon Edgson , 2007 BCCA 57 at para. 4 (C.A.  Chambers), Smith J.A. Generally, the considerations are the appellant's ability  to post security and the likelihood of costs awarded being recovered from it,  as well as the merits and the timeliness of the application : Southeast  Toyota Distributors, Inc. v. Branch  (1997), 45 B.C.L.R. (3d) 163 (C.A.);  Milina  v. Bartsch  (1985), 5 C.P.C. (2d) 124 at 125 (B.C.C.A. Chambers), Seaton  J.A.; and  M.(M.) v. F.(R.)  (1997), 43 B.C.L.R. (3d) 98 at 101 (C.A.  Chambers), Esson J.A. [8] In  Lu v. Mao , 2006 BCCA 560 (in Chambers),  Ryan J.A. explained: [6] In determining whether  security for costs should be ordered, the ultimate question to be answered is  whether the order would be in the interests of justice. In this regard, Madam  Justice Rowles in  Ferguson v. Ferstay  (2000), 81 B.C.L.R. (3d) 90 at para. 7;  2000 BCCA 592, (in Chambers) identified the following as relevant  considerations:  (1) appellant\u2019s financial means;  (2) the merits of the appeal;  (3) the timeliness of the  application; and  (4) whether the costs will be readily  recoverable. [8]     In opposing the order for security for costs, the appellant focuses on  the timeliness consideration. The notice of motion seeking this relief was  filed and served on January 16, 2019, well after the appeal documents and a  certificate of readiness were filed. The appeal is set to proceed on March 7,  2019, 31 days from today. The evidence is that the appellant is aged 84, does  not speak English and resides in China. The process of communicating with the  appellant requires translations by the appellant\u2019s daughter or granddaughter.  The trial costs have not been assessed, and I am told that no demand for  payment of trial costs was made before service of this application on January  16. [9]     I have no evidence as to the ability of the appellant to pay security  for costs, but the parties agree that it is likely that she has sufficient  resources. The issue is whether she can be compelled to do so if she is  unsuccessful in this appeal. [10]     In some cases, the fact that nearly all the costs required to prepare  the case for appeal, including costs of preparing the appeal books, transcripts  and factum, have been expended before the security for costs application is  brought, is of itself sufficient reason to dismiss the application: see e.g.,  Grewal  v. Khakh , 2018 BCCA 3 (Chambers) at para. 13;  Hayes v. Schimpf ,  2005 BCCA 413 (Chambers) at para. 11. In other cases, security may be  ordered on a late application when no unfairness would result to the appellant  as a result of the lack of timeliness: e.g.,  Ducharme v. Rempel , 2015  BCCA 437 (Chambers). But bringing the application so close to the scheduled  appeal date creates specific timeliness problems that mitigate against granting  an order that might otherwise have been given. [11]     Justice Esson addressed this problem in  M.(M.) v. F.(R.) , [1998]  9 W.W.R. 309 (B.C.C.A.) (in Chambers). In addressing the significance of the  upcoming appeal date, Esson J.A. (as then was) made these comments: [6] As I see it, the overriding difficulty with  respect to making any order is that the application comes so late. Had an  application for security been made at an earlier stage of the appeal  proceedings before the heavy costs of transcripts, appeal books and factum  preparation were incurred, it might well have been right to make an order for  security of costs, at least in respect of the costs in this Court and perhaps  also in the court below. \u2026 [7] An order for security for costs is ordinarily made  effective by providing that the appeal be stayed until security is posted. When  such an order is made in the earliest stages of the appeal, that can generally  be done without injustice to the appellant. But that is not possible on the eve  of the hearing, and so that ordinary form of sanction is out of the question. \u2026 [8] I conclude that at  this late stage of the proceeding, there is no feasible method to give Mrs. F.  the protection she seeks without injustice to the appellant. The application is  dismissed. [12]     The application described by Esson J.A. as being heard \u201con the eve of  the hearing\u201d was heard six weeks before the scheduled appeal date. In our case,  the application has been brought a month before the appeal date. If the order  was made, the appeal stayed, and the usual 30 days were given to the appellant  to arrange for the posting of security, it might not be until the day before  the hearing that the parties and the Court knew whether the appeal was going  ahead. This is not a tenable proposition, particularly when no satisfactory  reason has been given for the delay by the respondent in bringing this  application. The respondent has suggested that I might reduce the time  available to post security, but it does not appear to me appropriate to  truncate the usual time period when the problem arises from an untimely  application. [13]     In these particular circumstances, I am not prepared to make an order  for security for costs. Had the application been brought earlier, the result  might well have been different, at least as relates to the appeal costs, but at  this stage of the proceedings I am not satisfied that an order can be made  without injustice to the appellant. [14]     Accordingly, the application for security for costs of the appeal and  the trial is dismissed. \u201cThe  Honourable Mr. Justice Hunter\u201d",

Fransen   Insurance Services Ltd.,   2020 BCSC 8 Date: 20200106 Docket: S167414 Registry:  Vancouver Between: Trans Canada  Insurance Marketing Inc. Plaintiff And Fransen Insurance  Services Ltd.,   Fransen Insurance Services Ltd. dba Sea to Ski Insurance Services,   Antony Ronald Fransen, and InsureBC Underwriting Services Inc. Defendants Before:  The Honourable Madam Justice Forth Reasons for Judgment on Cost Counsel for the Plaintiff: M.D. Murphy Counsel for InsureBC Underwriting Services Inc.:   H. Poulus Q.C. A. Crimeni No other appearances   Place and Date of Written Submissions:   Submissions from the Defendant:   Submissions from the Plaintiff: Vancouver, B.C.   August 29, 2019   September   12, 2019 Reply submissions from the Defendant: September 19, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, B.C. January 6, 2020   [1]     These reasons deal with an application to vary my order for costs made  after the trial in this matter. The underlying action involved claims by the  plaintiff, Trans Canada Insurance Marketing Inc. (\u201cTrans Canada\u201d), against  InsureBC Underwriting Services (\u201cInsureBC\u201d) and three other defendants. In  December 2016, Trans Canada obtained default judgment against all of the  defendants except InsureBC. The trial was conducted for the purpose of  assessing damages on the default judgments and to try the issues against  InsureBC brought pursuant to the  Fraudulent Conveyance Act , R.S.B.C.  1996, c. 163 (the \u201c FCA \u201d), the  Fraudulent Preference Act ,  R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 164 (the \u201c FPA \u201d), and on the basis of unjust  enrichment.  [2]     On July 30, 2019, I issued reasons for judgment, indexed at 2019 BCSC  1250 (the \u201cReasons\u201d), dismissing all of the plaintiff\u2019s claims against  InsureBC. Trans Canada was ordered to pay InsureBC its costs at Scale B, but  leave was granted for the parties to make written submissions to vary the cost  order within 30 days of receipt of the Reasons.  [3]     On August 29, 2019, InsureBC filed written submissions seeking double  costs against the plaintiff for all steps taken in the litigation from the date  of an offer to settle made on November 26, 2018 (the \u201cOffer\u201d). On September 12,  2019, Trans Canada filed its response opposing the application. The Offer  provided: Our client is confident that [Trans Canada]\u2019s claim against  it will be dismissed in its entirety. However, in recognition that our client  will incur legal fees in the short term defending this lawsuit, our client is  willing to settle this matter on the following terms: 1.   InsureBC  will pay [Trans Canada] $10,000 (the \u201cSum\u201d), in full and final settlement of  its claim against InsureBC; 2.   The Sum is  inclusive of interest and costs; 3.   [Trans  Canada] will execute a release in a form acceptable to counsel; and 4.     [Trans Canada] will execute a consent dismissal order. [4]     The Offer was made without prejudice except as to costs. InsureBC  expressly reserved the right to bring the Offer to the attention of the Court  for consideration in relation to costs after judgment was pronounced, pursuant  to Rule 9-1 of the  Supreme Court Civil Rules , B.C. Reg. 168/2009 (the \u201c Rules \u201d).   [5]     The only issue to be addressed in these reasons is whether the costs  order should be varied to grant InsureBC double costs for all steps taken after  November 26, 2018.  [6]     The parties agree on the law that applies to the consideration of this  issue.  [7]     Rule 9-1(4) of the  Rules  provides that the Court may consider an  offer to settle when exercising its discretion in relation to costs. In a  proceeding in which an offer to settle has been made, Rule 9-1(5)(b) allows the  Court to award double costs of all or some of the steps taken in the proceeding  after the date of delivery or service of the offer to settle. Such an award is  a punitive measure against a litigant for their failure to accept an offer to  settle that, in all of the circumstances, should have been accepted:  Hartshorne  v. Hartshorne , 2011 BCCA 29 at para. 25.  [8]     Under Rule 9-1(6), the following factors may be considered in making an  order for costs in a proceeding in which an offer to settle has been made: (a)     whether the offer to settle was one that ought reasonably to have been  accepted; (b)     the relationship between the terms of settlement offered and the final  judgment of the court; (c)     the relative financial circumstances of the parties; and (d)     any other factor the court considers appropriate.  [9]     Whether an offer ought reasonably to have been accepted must be  determined by reference to the time the offer was open for acceptance, not by  reference to the ultimate decision:  Hartshorne  at para. 27.  Hartshorne   set out the following (non-exhaustive) factors for courts to consider in  deciding whether an offer ought reasonably to have been accepted:  (a)     the timing of the offer; (b)     whether the offer had some relationship to the claim or was instead a  nuisance offer; (c)     whether the offeree could easily have evaluated the offer; and (d)   whether the offeror provided  some rationale for the offer. [10]     The onus is on the party seeking to displace the usual rule as to costs,  which in this case is InsureBC:  Giles v. Westminster Savings Credit Union ,  2010 BCCA 282 at para. 75. [11]     InsureBC argues that the Offer was one that ought reasonably to have  been accepted. It was delivered two weeks before the start of the trial after  document disclosure, oral discoveries, and the trial management conference had  taken place. Therefore, Trans Canada should have been aware of the frailties of  its claim against InsureBC. It was in a position to easily evaluate the Offer,  which did not impact its ability to proceed against the other named defendants. [12]     InsureBC submits that the Offer was made in good faith in an attempt to  obtain certainty and resolve the matter without going to trial and incurring  further legal fees. The Offer was comprehensive and would have removed the need  for InsureBC to attend the five-day trial, which would have shortened the trial  length to two days, resulting in savings for the Court and the parties.  [13]     InsureBC points to the fact that the terms of the Offer are  significantly better than the result achieved at trial, as the claims against  it were dismissed in their entirety on the basis that Trans Canada lacked  standing to pursue its claim under the  FCA  and the  FPA  and the  elements for unjust enrichment were not made out.  [14]     Finally, InsureBC submits that both Trans Canada and InsureBC are sophisticated  commercial entities and a double costs award would do no measureable harm to  Trans Canada\u2019s financial status.  [15]     Trans Canada submits that there were several issues to be resolved in  its claims against InsureBC, making it reasonable to decide to proceed to trial  rather than accept the Offer. It submits that the evidence was capable of  supporting a claim against InsureBC, but the Court\u2019s interpretation of the  evidence ultimately led to the claim being dismissed. [16]     Trans Canada argues that it should not be penalized for pursuing the  action at trial based on its assessment of the merits, which proved to be  incorrect in hindsight but were reasonable and honestly held at the time. In  support of this point, Trans Canada points to the fact that it was successful  on several issues at trial, including the finding that the book of business was  \u201cproperty\u201d and that the assignment of the book of business constituted a  \u201cdisposition\u201d under the relevant legislation.  [17]     Trans Canada argues that the Offer came late in the day and it could not  be considered a reasonable offer; it was a nuisance or nominal offer. There was  nothing relating the Offer to the merits of the claim or the risk associated  with proceeding to trial that would have allowed Trans Canada to determine  whether it was reasonable. Instead, the Offer was predicated on the fact that  InsureBC would have to incur legal fees defending the lawsuit. It amounted to a  bald assertion that the claim would be dismissed, and given the fact that Trans  Canada sought an award in excess of $230,000, the amount offered by InsureBC  was a mere nuisance offer. [18]     Considering the factors set out by the Court of Appeal in  Hartshorne ,  I conclude that the Offer was one which ought reasonably to have been accepted  by Trans Canada.  [19]     I disagree that the timing of the Offer indicates that it was a mere  nuisance offer. To the contrary, I accept that the fact that the Offer came  late in the day, after discovery of documents and of key witnesses had taken  place and after the parties had participated in a trial management conference,  meant that Trans Canada would have known about the issues with its case against  InsureBC and would have been in a position to meaningfully evaluate the offer. [20]     Although it is true that Trans Canada was successful on certain issues  at trial, there were significant flaws in its position on key issues in its  case against InsureBC, which would have been apparent at the time the Offer was  made. In particular, its lack of standing as a \u201ccreditor\u201d under either the  FCA   or the  FPA  meant that those claims were bound to fail. The evidence  about when Trans Canada became a creditor compared to when the alleged  fraudulent transfer of property took place was not ambiguous. [21]     The unjust enrichment claim similarly had substantial vulnerabilities,  particularly because the enrichment InsureBC gained on the contract did not  produce a corresponding deprivation to Trans Canada. Again, this flaw in the claim  was not the result of ambiguities requiring the Court\u2019s interpretation of the  evidence before the parties could assess the strength of the argument, and it  should have been known to Trans Canada at the time the Offer was made. [22]     I also disagree that the Offer failed to provide a rationale for the  settlement or that Trans Canada had insufficient information to determine  whether the Offer was reasonable. As stated above, I accept that at the time  the Offer was made, Trans Canada had knowledge of the evidence and of the  parties\u2019 positions, which would allow it to assess the reasonableness of the  Offer. The Offer is clear that InsureBC\u2019s position was that the claims against  it would be dismissed in their entirety and that the basis for the Offer was to  save the legal fees it would incur defending the claim at trial.  [23]     This factor weighs in favour of allowing InsureBC\u2019s application to vary  costs. [24]     The relationship between the terms of the Offer and my final judgment in  this matter also weighs in favour of allowing InsureBC\u2019s application. In my  Reasons, I dismissed the claims against InsureBC in their entirety and awarded  costs in their favour. A $10,000 offer would have been a significantly better  result for Trans Canada. [25]     Furthermore, because the Offer was comprehensive, its acceptance would  have meant that InsureBC\u2019s participation in the trial would not be necessary.  Such an outcome would have significantly narrowed the issues and saved both parties  and the Court three days of time and expense.  [26]     In the absence of any contrary submissions from Trans Canada, I accept  InsureBC\u2019s submission that an award for double costs on steps taken after the Offer  was presented would not do significant financial harm to Trans Canada. Both  parties are commercial entities and they are comparable in terms of their level  of sophistication.  [27]     I find that InsureBC has met its onus of demonstrating that an award for  double costs for steps taken in the litigation after the date of the Offer  should be granted.  [28]     The costs order will be varied to award: (a)     InsureBC its costs at Scale B to November 26, 2018; and (b)   InsureBC double costs at  Scale B in respect of all steps taken in the proceeding after November 26,  2018. \u201cForth  J.\u201d",

Thomson Appellant (Plaintiff) And Her  Majesty the Queen in the Right of British Columbia, Interior Health Authority,  Royal Inland Hospital, Kamloops Mental Health and Substance Use, Dr. Kurt  Buller and Dr. James Mabee Respondents (Defendants) Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice Goepel (In Chambers) On appeal from: An  order of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, dated October 28, 2020 ( Thomson  v. British Columbia (Interior Health) , 2020 BCSC 1591, Kamloops Docket  58631).  The Appellant, appearing in person     (via videoconference): N.E. Thomson Counsel for the Respondent, Her Majesty the Queen in the   Right of the Province of British Columbia     (via videoconference): L.F. de Lima    J. Salter, Articled Student Counsel for the Respondents, Interior Health Authority,   Royal Inland Hospital, Kamloops Mental Health & Substance Use (via   videoconference): D.J.A. Bell    E. Dvorak Counsel for the Respondents, Dr. Kurt Buller and Dr. James   Mabee     (via videoconference): D.C. Froese Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 6, 2022 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British   Columbia February 1, 2022 Summary: The  appellant\u2019s application seeks an extension of time to file an appeal from a  judgment dated October 28, 2020. Held: Application dismissed. The appeal was  brought over a year out of time. Upon an application of the Davies factors,  there is no evidence that the appellant had a bona fide intention to appeal  during the relevant appeal period, the appeal has no merit, and the interests  of justice do not favour granting the application.  Reasons for Judgment of the Honourable  Mr. Justice Goepel: [1]     The appellant, Neil Thomson, seeks to appeal the order of Justice Dley  made on October 28, 2020, dismissing the appellant\u2019s claim on the basis of  res  judicata . Justice Dley\u2019s reasons are indexed at 2020 BCSC 1591. [2]     The appellant filed his notice of leave to appeal on November 3, 2021,  more than one year after the release of the reasons for judgment. He now  applies for leave to appeal, an order to extend the time period to bring his  application for leave to appeal and a no fees order. [3]     On July 12, 2016, the appellant commenced Action number 053209 (the  \u201c2016 Action\u201d), for damages allegedly sustained from the appellant\u2019s  involuntary admission to Royal Inland Hospital pursuant to the  Mental Health  Act , R.S.B.C. 1996 c. 288 between November 2000 and his ultimate  discharge from involuntary patient status in February 2013.  [4]     Justice Meiklem dismissed the 2016 Action on September 29, 2017 on the  grounds that it was barred by the  Limitation Act , R.S.B.C. 1996,  c. 266. In his reasons for judgment, he held that the basic two-year  limitation period for the appellant\u2019s cause of action arose on October 4, 2012,  and the postponement provisions of the  Limitation Act  did not apply.  Justice Meiklem\u2019s reasons are indexed at 2017 BCSC 1742. This Court, in reasons  indexed at 2018 BCCA 380, affirmed Justice Meiklem\u2019s decision. The appellant\u2019s  application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was refused:  [2018] S.C.C.A. No. 38489. [5]     On February 12, 2020, the appellant commenced Action No. 058631  [the \u201c2020 Action\u201d] against the same defendants and for the same relief or  similar relief as the 2016 Action. On October 8, 2020, Justice Dley heard the  defendant\u2019s application to dismiss the 2020 Action. At the hearing before  Justice Dley, the appellant argued that new evidence distinguished the 2020  Action from the 2016 Action.  [6]     In his reasons released on October 28, 2020, Justice Dley dismissed the  2016 Action. He considered the new evidence and found it would not be  practically conclusive and therefore did not justify reopening an issue that  had already been decided. In that regard, he said:  [14]     It cannot be said the proposed new evidence entirely changes the case.  The nature of the new evidence was already considered in the trial decision and  on appeal. I therefore conclude that the new evidence would not be practically  conclusive and so does not justify reopening an issue that has already been  decided. [7]     Justice Dley held that the action should be dismissed based on the  doctrine of  res judicata.  In his reasons he noted that the doctrine has  two aspects, being issue estoppel and cause of action estoppel. He found that  both applied in this case. In that regard, he said: [17] I conclude that issue estoppel applies in these  circumstances. Mr. Thomson must show that he has brought his claim within  the allowable limitation period before this action can proceed. The prior  action considered this issue and held that the action was statute barred. I  therefore find: a) The same question (i.e. whether the action can be  brought) has already been decided; b) The decision in the prior action was final; and c) The parties in both action[s] are the same. [18] I also conclude that cause of action estoppel  applies because: a) The trial decision, as affirmed on appeal, was final; b) The parties to this litigation are the same as those  in the prior action; c) The cause of action was the same, i.e. Mr. Thomson  being detained under the  MHA ; and d) All matters as argued here (including references to  the  Charter ) were argued or could have been argued in the prior action. [8]     In the result, he held the action must be dismissed under the doctrine  of  res judicata. [9]     The appellant\u2019s time limit to appeal the order of Justice Dley expired  on November 27, 2020. The appellant took no steps until filing a notice of  application for leave to appeal on November 3, 2021. The defendants had no  notice of the appellant\u2019s intention to appeal until served with the notice of  application for leave. [10]     The criteria governing whether an extension of time ought to be granted  are set out in  Davies v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce , (1987) 15  B.C.L.R. (2d) 256 (C.A.) at 259\u2013260. They are: 1. Was there a  bona fide   intention to appeal? 2. When were the respondents  informed of the intention? 3. Would the respondents be  unduly prejudiced by an extension? 4. Is there merit in the  appeal? 5. Is it in the interest of  justice that an extension be granted? [11]     The overriding question is whether it is in the interests of justice to  grant the extension:  First Majestic Silver Corp. v. Santos , 2014 BCCA  214 at para. 57, leave to appeal ref\u2019d, [2014] S.C.C.A. No. 35962. [12]     An extension of time to file a notice for appeal should not be granted  if the appeal is without merit:  Franks v. British Columbia (B.C. Benefits  Board) , 1999 BCCA 165 (Proudfoot J.A. in Chambers) at para. 10, aff\u2019d  1999 BCCA 407, leave to appeal ref\u2019d, [1999] S.C.C.A. No. 361;  Stewart  v. Postnikoff , 2015 BCCA 388 at para. 10. [13]     At the hearing of the application it was agreed that the appellant does  not need leave to appeal. He can appeal Justice Dley\u2019s decision as of right. He  does, however, require an extension of time. It is to that issue I now turn. [14]     The appeal was brought more than a year out of time. There is no  evidence that the appellant had a  bona fide  intention of appealing  during the appeal period. The respondents only learned of the appeal when they were  served with the appellant\u2019s notice of leave to appeal. More importantly, there  is no merit in the appeal. The limitation issue, which doomed the 2016 Action,  remains an unsurmountable bar to the 2020 Action. As noted by Justice Dley, the  2016 Action found the action statute barred and this claim could only proceed  if the appellant can show that he brought the claim within the allowable  limitation period. The appellant is unable to do so. [15]     Given the above circumstances, it is not in the interests of justice to  grant an extension of time to bring the appeal. I would dismiss the  application. Given this result, it is not necessary to consider the no fee  application. \u201cThe  Honourable Mr. Justice Goepel\u201d",

Veeken,   2020 BCCA 54 Date: 20200117 Docket: CA45929 Between: Regina   Respondent And Paul Peter Veeken   Appellant Restriction on  publication: A publication ban has been imposed under    s. 486.4 of the  Criminal Code  restricting the publication,  broadcasting or    transmission in any way of evidence that could identify the complainant in this     matter. This publication ban applies indefinitely unless otherwise ordered. Pursuant to s. 16(4)  of the  Sex Offender Information and Registration Act    [ SOIRA ], no person shall disclose any information that is collected  pursuant to    an order under  SOIRA  or the fact that information relating to a person  is    collected under  SOIRA . Before: The Honourable Madam Justice Saunders The Honourable Mr. Justice Fitch The Honourable Mr. Justice Grauer On appeal from: An  order of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, dated    December 12, 2018 (conviction) ( R. v. Veeken ,  2018 BCSC 2429,    Prince George Docket 37730\u20112). Oral Reasons for Judgment Counsel for the Appellant: S.R. Wright Counsel for the Respondent: J.R.W. Caldwell Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British Columbia January 17, 2020 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia January 17, 2020   Summary: The appellant challenges his  conviction for sexual interference on various grounds including that the judge  erred by: (1) editing the oral reasons for judgment after they were  delivered; and (2) shifting the burden of proof. Held: Appeal allowed  and a new trial is ordered. It is unnecessary for this Court to address the  extent to which trial judges can edit their oral reasons for judgment after  delivery. The edited reasons for judgment, standing alone, establish that the  judge erred in law by shifting the burden of proof. The judge erroneously  concluded that he could neither accept the appellant\u2019s evidence nor find that  it raised a reasonable doubt in the absence of independent evidence  that confirmed the appellant\u2019s denial of wrongdoing. [1]     FITCH J.A. : The appellant was convicted by a Supreme Court judge  of sexual interference contrary to s. 151 of the  Criminal Code ,  R.S.C. 1985, c. C\u201146. The offence arose out of incidents said  to have occurred when the complainant was between 10\u201312 years of age.  At the relevant time, the appellant was 38\u201340 years of age. The alleged  incidents involved the appellant repeatedly touching the complainant\u2019s breasts  and vaginal area, typically in the course of tickling her when the  complainant visited the appellant at his family\u2019s cabin. [2]     The appellant testified. He denied ever touching the complainant for a  sexual purpose. [3]     This was the second trial in this matter \u2014 a new trial  having been ordered by this Court in reasons for judgment indexed as  2017 BCCA 417. [4]     There was no direct evidence confirming the complainant\u2019s testimony  that the appellant repeatedly touched her breasts and vaginal area. The  trial judge recognized that the resolution of the case turned on his credibility findings  and the application of the framework set out in  R. v. W.(D.) ,  [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742, to the circumstances of this case. [5]     The three\u2011step  W.(D.)  analysis is designed to  assist the trier of fact in properly applying the reasonable doubt standard  to the issue of credibility. Where, as here, an accused denies the commission of the offence,  a trier of fact must find the accused not guilty if they believe  the accused\u2019s evidence or, even if they do not believe the accused\u2019s evidence,  they are left in reasonable doubt by it. If the trier of fact does not believe  the accused\u2019s denial and is not left with a reasonable doubt  by the accused\u2019s testimony, a conviction can only result where the Crown  discharges its burden of establishing guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. [6]     In oral reasons for judgment indexed as 2018 BCSC 2429,  the judge rejected the appellant\u2019s evidence, found that the appellant\u2019s evidence  did not raise a reasonable doubt, and accepted the complainant\u2019s evidence  that the appellant repeatedly touched her for a sexual purpose. [7]     On appeal, the appellant submits that the judge erred by: (1) editing  the oral reasons for judgment after they were delivered; (2) shifting  the burden of proof; (3) misapprehending evidence; and (4) providing  insufficient reasons for judgment. [8]     The first ground of appeal raises an important question  of practice concerning the extent to which trial judges are entitled to  edit reasons given orally. This Court has addressed the point on  several occasions:  R. v. Walton , 2011 BCCA 535  at para. 21;  R. v. Pham  (6 September 2011),  Vancouver CA038676 (B.C.C.A. Chambers). We have consistently held that  while trial judges cannot edit or change their oral reasons \u201cin  an attempt to defeat an appeal\u201d, judges are entitled to edit their  reasons \u201cto a degree\u201d as, for example, where words have been  misspoken or some clarification is necessary. I should add that no suggestion  has been made in this case that the judge undertook an editing process  to defeat an appeal. In fact, the edited judgment was released  before the notice of appeal was filed in this Court. [9]     A similar approach to this issue was taken by the Alberta Court of Appeal  in  R. v. Schell , 2004 ABCA 143 at paras. 43 and 45.  In that case, it was held that the judge did nothing impermissible by deleting  a sentence from her oral reasons for judgment in circumstances where \u201cthe \u2026 written reasons  [did] not deviate from the general thrust of their oral predecessor\u201d: citing Roman N. Komar,   Reasons for Judgment: A Handbook for Judges and Other Judicial Officers   (Toronto: Butterworths, 1980) at 16. [10]     It appears that a more restrictive view has been taken by the  Ontario Court of Appeal:  R. v. Wang , 2010 ONCA 435  at paras. 9\u201311. In that case, trial judges were cautioned  against modifying, changing or adding to a transcript of oral reasons  rendered in court except to correct \u201cpunctuation, grammatical errors  and the like.\u201d The court endorsed the proposition that reasons for judgment  are not meant to be tentative and counsel who receive a transcript of oral reasons  should not \u201cbe left to wonder whether it in fact reflects what was said in the court,  or rather constitutes a version of the reasons as later modified by the judge.\u201d [11]     In this case, the judge amended his oral reasons for judgment  by deleting from the transcribed version words said in court,  including language the appellant says would have supported his second ground of appeal.  The appellant submits that the amendments made were substantive in nature and  exceeded the authority trial judges have to edit oral reasons. [12]     In the alternative, the appellant argues that the edited reasons for judgment,  standing alone, establish that the judge erred in law by shifting the  burden of proof. [13]     I agree with the appellant\u2019s alternative submission on this issue. In  my view, reversible error in law is reflected in the edited version of the  reasons for judgment. As a consequence, it is unnecessary for this  Court to address the extent to which trial judges can edit their oral reasons for judgment  to properly dispose of this appeal. In these circumstances, the issue is  best left to be explored another day. [14]     Further, as I am of the view that a new trial is required as a  consequence of the error identified in the appellant\u2019s second ground of appeal,  I consider it unnecessary to address the appellant\u2019s other grounds of appeal. [15]     The reasons, as edited and transcribed, reflect the following application  of the first two steps of the  W.(D.)  framework to  the evidence in this case: [72] Accordingly, the first step in the analysis in  the case at bar is whether I accept, as true, Mr. Veeken\u2019s testimony  that he did not touch [the complainant\u2019s] breast and vaginal areas  at any time. In this regard, the Crown characterizes Mr. Veeken\u2019s evidence  as a \u201cbare denial\u201d and while the defence acknowledges that this is  so, it points out that there is \u201cnot much else\u201d that Mr. Veeken can do to  meet the allegations against him.  It is not controversial that there is no  reliable evidence supporting Mr. Veeken\u2019s denial. [73]  In these circumstances, I am satisfied that a  finding that Mr. Veeken\u2019s denial is true cannot reasonably be made.   I am mindful that the defence has urged me to rely upon Mr. Veeken\u2019s testimonial demeanour  and manner, by submitting that Mr. Veeken was forthright, gave full answers,  explained suggested inconsistencies, and was not shaken in cross\u2011examination.  I am not persuaded, however, that Mr. Veeken\u2019s demeanour and manner  are a sound basis for accepting his testimony as true. Notably, the Crown did  not agree with the defence\u2019s assessment; rather, it characterized Mr. Veeken  as glib and evasive. These widely divergent views of the   same testimony only serve to demonstrate the  frailty of manner and demeanour as the basis for determining the  truthfulness of a witness. [74]  The  next step, then, is whether Mr. Veeken\u2019s testimony raises a  reasonable doubt as to his guilt. This is similarly problematic in the absence  of reliable evidence that supports, directly or indirectly, Mr. Veeken\u2019s  denial.  Moreover, Mr. Veeken admits having [the complainant] on his lap  and tickling her; he admits pulling her onto his lap while in the hot tub;  and, he admits spending evenings and nights with only [the complainant] and  her nine\u2011year\u2011old brother. [Emphasis added.] [16]     In my view, these paragraphs support the appellant\u2019s submission  that his evidence was rejected and found not to raise a reasonable doubt  because it was not confirmed by any other reliable evidence. Beyond the  obvious challenge of requiring the appellant to adduce evidence supporting  his denial \u2014 in effect, to corroborate a negative \u2014 the trial judge\u2019s approach  had the effect of erroneously shifting the burden of proof. [17]     The judge was certainly entitled to reject the appellant\u2019s evidence  and find that it did not raise a reasonable doubt about his guilt.  The difficulty in this case arises because of the judge\u2019s conclusion that  he could neither accept the appellant\u2019s evidence nor find that it raised a  reasonable doubt in the absence of independent and reliable evidence  supporting his account. To approach the issue this way was to  erroneously shift the burden to the accused to adduce evidence  that confirmed his denial of wrongdoing. [18]     While I appreciate that the reasons for judgment must be read  in their entirety and assessed as a whole, the error in law was the  starting place for the judge\u2019s  W.(D.)  analysis and, in my view,  one so fundamental that it taints his reasons as a whole. [19]     For the foregoing reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the conviction,  and order a new trial. [20]     In light of the disposition, I propose it is unnecessary  to resolve the application to admit fresh evidence. [21]     SAUNDERS J.A. : I agree. [22]     GRAUER J.A. : I agree. [23]     SAUNDERS J.A. : The appeal is allowed, the conviction  is set aside, and there is an order for a new trial. \u201cThe Honourable Mr. Justice Fitch\u201d",

Before: The Honourable Madam Justice Newbury The Honourable Mr. Justice Hunter The Honourable Mr. Justice Grauer On appeal from: An  order of the Provincial Court of British Columbia, dated    March 28, 2019 ( R. v. [N.P.] , Cranbrook Docket 3834-1). Oral Reasons for Judgment Counsel for the Appellant (via videoconference): J.L. Martin Counsel for the Respondent (via videoconference): N.G. Melling Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 14, 2021 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 14, 2021   Summary: The appellant, N.P., was  convicted of sexual assault of his stepsister. N.P. submitted, and the Crown  conceded, that the judge erred by admitting Facebook messages between the complainant  and her father following the alleged assault as consistent statements which  reflected positively on her credibility. Held: Appeal allowed and new trial  ordered. The prior consistent statements of the complainant should not have  been entered into evidence or considered by the trial judge in assessing her  credibility or corroborating her testimony. Prior consistent statements are  presumptively inadmissible and no exception to this rule applied in this case.  [1]     NEWBURY J.A. : The Crown has conceded that this appeal should be  allowed and a new trial ordered, and I agree with that disposition.  [2]     Mr. P was convicted of the sexual assault of B.M. At the time, he  was 15 years old. B.M. was his stepsister and was then age 16. B.M.  testified that at about 1:00 a.m. on July 24, 2018, the appellant and  B.M. were staying at the home of her paternal grandparents. Apparently they  were expected to sleep on the same couch. The two were at opposite ends of a  sectional; she was positioned on one end of the couch with her feet towards him  at the other end. She testified at trial that he began to rub her legs with his  hand. When she moved her legs away, he tried to \u201ctouch her and [run] his hand  up her leg.\u201d (Reasons at para. 3.) He then crawled on top of her and  grabbed her breasts. She responded by repeatedly saying \u2018no\u2019 and told him to  stop. He said, \u201cThen blow me and I\u2019ll leave you alone.\u201d When she refused, he  again grabbed her breasts and as she tried to move away, grabbed her by the  hips and pulled her back onto the couch. She testified that he pulled her  pyjama pants to her knees and inserted his penis into her vagina.  [3]     The appellant testified in his defence, agreeing with virtually all of  the foregoing, except that he denied touching B.M. sexually or at all.  [4]     The Crown entered into evidence a series of Instagram messages between  the appellant and B.M. In one these exchanges, which took place two months  before   the alleged offence, B.M. told Mr. P it was \u201cwack\u201d \u2014 i.e., absurd \u2014 for  him to try to \u201csmash\u201d her \u2014 i.e., have sex with her \u2014 given that he was her (half)  brother. His reply was, \u201cOf course I am I\u2019m 15 and your [sic] sexy.\u201d In his  testimony, the appellant explained these messages as being simply \u201cstupid\u201d and  the result of his being drunk at the time. [5]     The Crown also sought to adduce into evidence some Facebook messages  between B.M. and her father  later in the morning of July 24, 2018 ,  in which she complained of what had happened, in a manner that was, in the  trial judge\u2019s words, \u201cconsistent with what she testified to.\u201d (At para. 16.)  Details of these messages are set forth at para. 21 of the appellant\u2019s  factum.  [6]     In an exchange with Crown counsel, the trial judge suggested that B.M.\u2019s  \u201cprior consistent statements\u201d, while not admissible for the truth of their  contents, were  admissible and could be used in assessing her credibility ,  on either the second or third branch of  R. v .  W.D.  [1991] 1  S.C.R. 742. Defence counsel agreed that the Facebook messages could be  used to assess credibility, \u201cto the extent that it rebuts any sort of  suggestion of a ... recent fabrication.\u201d He continued, \u201cI could concede that,  to the extent that she hasn\u2019t made up some story later on. I would submit that  it would be \u2014 should be assessed for that limited purpose ....\u201d In fact, there  was no evidence that would have supported recent fabrication by B.M. of her  evidence.  [7]     No  voir dire  was held to determine the admissibility of the  consistent statements from Facebook.  [8]     At para. 5 of his reasons, the trial judge correctly stated the  three prongs of  R. v. W.D . On the first branch, he said he did not  believe the appellant\u2019s denial of sexual contact and characterized Mr. P\u2019s  explanation of the Instagram messages as \u201cnot compelling\u201d. With respect to the  second branch of  W.D. , the judge found that the appellant\u2019s evidence did  not raise a doubt, and that: He acknowledges in his evidence  that in sending an eggplant emoji and referring to \u201clicked\u201d he was asking B.M.  to perform a blowjob, that is to say, fellatio. It is consistent with B.M.\u2019s evidence  that on the couch he asked her to \u201cblow\u201d him. [At para. 13.] [9]     Turning next to the third branch of  W.D. , the judge said this: ... I turn to consider the balance of the evidence. I found  the evidence of B.M. to be credible and compelling. Indeed, with respect to the  surrounding facts, including opportunity, it was confirmed by [Mr. P]. Furthermore, the Instagram exchange between them, and to  which I have already referred, is consistent with what she alleges occurred  later in this assault. Other than [Mr. P]\u2019s denial being put to her, she  was not challenged or inconsistent in any way. Lastly, in Exhibit 1, pages 2 to 7, the Facebook messages  between B.M. and her father later in the morning on July 24, 2018, she  complained to her father of what occurred, which was again consistent with what  she testified to.  While those   Facebook messages from her are  not proof of what occurred, they are consistent with her evidence and reflect  positively on her credibility . In conclusion, I accept the  evidence of B.M. that she was assaulted by [Mr. P] just as she described.  [At paras. 14\u20137; emphasis added.]  [10]     In the result, the appellant was found guilty as charged. [11]     Statements consistent with a witness\u2019s evidence are normally regarded as  self\u2011serving evidence and are presumptively inadmissible because they (i) lack  probative value and (ii) constitute hearsay when adduced for the truth of  their contents: see  R. v. Stirling  2008 SCC 10 at para. 5;   R. v. Dinardo  2008 SCC 24 at para. 36;  R. v. Ellard   2009 SCC 27 at para. 27;  R. v. M (E-H)  2015 BCCA 54 at para. 46;  and more recently,  R. v. Gill  2018 BCCA 275 at para. 65. As  S.N. Lederman, A.W. Bryant and M.K. Fuerst observe in  The Law  of Evidence in Canada  (5 th  ed., 2018) at \u00a77.3, in addition  to the lack of probative value of such evidence, the most common rationale for  the rule is the risk of fabrication: no one should be allowed to create  evidence for him or herself. An exception historically existed in sexual  assault cases for \u201crecent complaints\u201d made by complainants soon after the  incident complained of, but that exception was abrogated by an amendment to the   Criminal Code  in 1983. (See now s. 275.)  [12]     There are several other exceptions to the rule but, in my view, none of  them is remotely applicable to this case. I have already mentioned that no  imputation of recent fabrication arises. The Crown suggested in its factum that  the exception known as \u201cnarrative as circumstantial evidence\u201d \u2014 where out\u2011of\u2011court  statements made by a complainant in a sexual assault case may be used for the  \u201climited purpose of helping the trier of fact to understand how the complainant\u2019s  story was initially disclosed\u201d ( Dinardo  at para. 37) \u2014 might have  application, but I cannot agree. Cases in which it has applied have generally  involved witnesses who because of age, infirmity or similar circumstances are  unable to testify or have a particular difficulty beyond their control, in  testifying. In  Dinardo  itself, the complainant was young person with a  disability. In  R. v. G.C.  [2006] O.J. No. 2245 (C.A.), the  complainant was 8 years old. The Supreme Court in  Dinardo  approved  the reasoning of the majority in  G.C.  that her prior consistent  statements could be admitted, emphasizing at para. 39 that she had had  difficulty in situating events in time, was easily confused, and lied on occasion.   [13]     At the same time, the Supreme Court in  Dinardo  approved the Court  of Appeal\u2019s conclusion in  G.C . that the trial judge had  erred  in  admitting the  content  of the complainant\u2019s prior consistent statements  to  corroborate  her testimony at trial. Both courts cited with approval the  observation of the Ontario Court of Appeal in  R. v. F.(J.E.)  (1993) 85  C.C.C. (3d) 457 that:  The  fact  that the statements were made  is admissible to assist the jury as to the  sequence of events from the alleged offence to the prosecution so that they can  understand the conduct of the complainant and assess her truthfulness. However,  the jury must be instructed that they are not to look to the  content  of  the statement as proof that a crime has been committed. [At 476; emphasis  added.]  [14]     Very recently, in  R. v. Langan  2020 SCC 33, the Supreme  Court adopted the reasons of Chief Justice Bauman, dissenting, reported at 2019  BCCA 467. The Chief Justice quoted with approval passages from  Gill,   including this:  The prior consistent statement  is  not admitted for the truth of its contents or as a form of self-corroboration  of the trial testimony of the witness . The trier of fact also must not rely  on the statement to support the prohibited inference that repetition enhances  truthfulness. Rather, \u201cthe probative value of the statement lies in the  inferences that can be drawn from the timing and circumstances of the  statement,  rather than the simple fact that the [witness] has said the same  thing before \u201d . . . [At para. 91; emphasis added.] [15]     The situations in which the \u201cnarrative\u201d exception may be relied upon,  then, are limited, and in any event such statements are not to be used for a  hearsay purpose \u2014 i.e., as a \u201cform of self-corroboration\u201d. ( Gill  at para. 76.)  No difficulty like that encountered in  Dinardo  or  G.C.  arose with  respect to the complainant\u2019s testimony in the case at bar; nor was it contended  that the  timing or fact  of her complaint was of \u201cindependent cogency\u201d in  assessing that testimony. It follows in my opinion that the prior consistent  statements of B.M. should not have been entered into evidence or considered by  the trial judge in assessing her credibility or corroborating her testimony. The  only relevance these statements could have had was to support the \u201cprohibited  inference that repetition enhances truthfulness.\u201d ( Gill  at para. 76.) [16]     I also agree with the Crown that the curative proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii)  cannot properly be applied in this case. As Mr. Melling acknowledged, it  cannot safely be said that defence counsel made a tactical decision not to  object; and the trial judge gave sufficient importance to the Facebook evidence  to suggest that it did figure significantly in his reasoning.  [17]     In the result, I am satisfied that we have no choice but to allow the  appeal, and order that the case be remitted for retrial.  [18]     I thank counsel for their helpful submissions.

Lloyd,   2019 BCCA 25 Date: 20190115 Docket: CA45046 Between: Regina Respondent And Joseph Ryan Lloyd Appellant Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice Harris The Honourable Madam Justice Stromberg-Stein The Honourable Madam Justice Fenlon On appeal from: An  order of the Provincial Court of British Columbia, dated September 18, 2017  (conviction) and January 5, 2018 (sentence) ( R. v. Lloyd , Vancouver  Registry 233735-2-C). Oral Reasons for Judgment Counsel for the Appellant: D.N. Fai Counsel for the Respondent: J.N. Walker Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 15, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 15, 2019   Summary: Appeal of convictions on basis  that an arrest search incidental to arrest that produced evidence on which some  of the convictions depended was unlawful and the search unreasonable. Appeal  dismissed; the judge did not misapprehend the evidence critical to her  conclusion that the arrest was lawful, the search was reasonable, and the  evidence was admissible.  [1]     HARRIS J.A. : Mr. Lloyd appeals his conviction of multiple  counts of possession of controlled substances for the purposes of trafficking,  carrying a concealed weapon (a knife), possession of a weapon for a purpose  dangerous to the public peace, obstructing a peace officer, and assaulting a  peace officer with a weapon. [2]     Critical to his convictions was the result of a voir dire held to  determine the admissibility of evidence seized in a search incidental to his  arrest. Mr. Lloyd contended that his arrest was unlawful and accordingly  the search was unreasonable. [3]     It is not necessary to recount the facts in detail. In short, Mr. Lloyd  was approached by two plain clothes police officers as he sat with another man  outside a coffee shop. The judge accepted that the officers advised the men  that they were police officers investigating a bylaw infraction for smoking  within six metres of a doorway. They advised them that they were not free to leave.  They asked for their names and dates of birth. The accused was uncooperative  but eventually gave his name. One of the officers queried both names on the  computer in the police car. Before the process was complete, the other officer  noticed a bulge in the accused\u2019s clothing that he suspected to be a weapon. He  called a warning to the police officer in the vehicle, who returned to the  scene.  [4]     The officers were concerned that the accused was about to run. They  advised him again that he was not free to go and warned him of the offence of  obstructing police. One officer attempted to grab his arm. A fight ensued and  the accused attempted to draw a knife. The police knocked it out of his hand  and a bystander retrieved it. The fight was intense. The accused was arrested  and searched while handcuffed, lying on the ground, and still struggling. He  was found to be carrying a leather purse under his shirt which contained 25.7  grams of cocaine, 56.59 grams of methamphetamine, and 51.29 grams of heroin and  fentanyl in combination. The drugs were in small plastic bags. The accused was  also carrying a digital scale, two knives, and $1,780 in cash. [5]     The defence argued that the evidence should be excluded because the  whole police interaction was a ruse for the purposes of interacting with the  accused. Alternatively, the defence argued that the arrest for obstruction was  unlawful, because the officers had already completed the identification of the  accused: they had learned his name and one of them recognized the name. Therefore  there was no further reason to detain him, the arrest was unlawful, and the  ensuing search violated s. 8 of the  Charter . The defence also  argued that the police tried to conceal, in their initial report to Crown  counsel, the original purpose for their surveillance, and that this should cast  doubt on all their evidence. [6]     The judge concluded that the arrest was lawful, the search was  reasonable, and the evidence was admissible. She found that the police did not  try to conceal the initial purpose of their investigation. She found the facts  as I have set them out above. In so doing, she rejected the position on the  facts taken by Mr. Lloyd\u2019s counsel. She accepted that the police had not  completed their confirmation of Mr. Lloyd\u2019s identity. The officers were  still engaged in the execution of their duty to identify the accused at the  time of the obstructive conduct. She concluded that the arrest was lawful. The  search conducted incidental to that arrest did not violate s. 8 of the  Charter .  There was justification for a safety search, as the officers had reason to  believe the accused was carrying a weapon and was backing away while blading  his body away from the officer.  [7]     The evidence from the voir dire was admitted as evidence at trial. The  findings of fact made in the voir dire reasons formed the foundation of the  reasons for conviction. Mr. Lloyd contends that the judge made multiple  errors in the conclusions she reached, but, in my view, they boil down to the  proposition that the judge misapprehended the evidence in ways that  contaminated her critical finding that the arrest was lawful. [8]     As is well known, this Court shows deference to the findings of fact  made by a trial judge in the absence of demonstrable error. In this particular  case, I do not think the appeal can succeed unless Mr. Lloyd can  demonstrate that the judge committed palpable and overriding errors of fact  through misapprehending critical evidence. If the facts, as found by the trial  judge are accepted, there is, in my view, not other basis to interfere with the  convictions. [9]     I do not think that Mr. Lloyd has done more than reargue his case  at trial. He has not demonstrated any reversible error in the judge\u2019s findings  or reasoning. What he has done is attempt to persuade us that the judge ought  to have reached different conclusions, for example, by taking a different view  of the credibility of the officers or in her assessment of whether subjective and  objective grounds existed for the arrest. I am satisfied that the judge did not  misapprehend the evidence in the manner required to justify appellate  intervention. All of the material findings of fact made by the judge were open  to her on, and well-supported by, the evidence. On that basis, I would dismiss  the appeal substantially for the reasons given by the judge.  [10]     STROMBERG-STEIN J.A. : I agree. [11]     FENLON J.A. : I agree. [12]     HARRIS J.A. : The appeal is dismissed. \u201cThe  Honourable Mr. Justice Harris\u201d",

Video Clip 307 and Video Clip 310 are from  CCTV surveillance footage of the lobby and elevator bank at the Fairmont  Pacific Rim Estates, a residential building on West Cordova Street in  Vancouver, BC. Video Clip 71 is video footage taken by a member of the  Vancouver Police Department (\u201cVPD\u201d) surveillance team who was part of a team following  the movements of a male believed to be Jacob Pereira, one of Mr. Szucs'  co-accused on this indictment. Video Clip 71 appears to depict Mr. Pereira and  Mr. Szucs leaving the Fairmont Pacific Rim Hotel, which is connected to the Fairmont  Pacific Rim Estates, approximately eight minutes after Mr. Pereira can be seen  waiting to travel up the elevator inside the Fairmont Pacific Rim Estates. [4]     All three video clips depict a man who appears to Jacob Pereira wearing  a red leather jacket and carrying a beige coloured backpack. The time of the  three video clips is between 14:02 hours and 14:13 hours on June 19, 2017.  [5]     The backpack figures in this  voir dire  as it is the backpack that  VPD surveillance members observed being placed by Mr. Pereira into a black  Dodge Durango that Mr. Szucs was driving that day. That vehicle was pulled over  later on in the afternoon of June 19, 2017, by a member of the Hope, BC RCMP at  the request and direction of the VPD. [6]     The Crown objects to the admission of these three video clips on the  basis of relevance. The Crown argues that because the issue on this  voir  dire  is whether Detective Constable Hill had reasonable grounds to arrest Mr.  Szucs and because Detective Constable Hill had not seen the video clips before  Mr. Szucs' arrest and they did not form the basis for his subjective grounds,  the video clips are irrelevant and ought not to be admitted.  [7]     The Crown advanced two other bases for the objection, but at the end of  argument, the Crown acknowledged that   the real basis for objecting to  the admissibility is relevance. Accordingly, I will only address the relevance  ground. [8]     The defence asserts the video clips are relevant to assist the Court in  determining the objective reasonableness of Detective Constable Hill's subjective  grounds. One of Detective Constable Hill\u2019s grounds was that he had been advised  by a VPD surveillance team member that the backpack that the man believed to be  Jacob Pereira was carrying that afternoon appeared to be \"distinctly  heavier\" after he was seen exiting a vehicle driven by Gurvinder Randhawa  at approximately 13:48 hours at Nelson and Richards Street in Vancouver, BC. Mr.  Pereira and Mr. Randhawa had a one-minute meeting in Mr. Randhawa's  Ford Fusion. When Mr. Pereira left the Ford Fusion, surveillance members  described the backpack, as related in the master surveillance reports, as  looking \"distinctly heavier\", \"very heavy\", and that \"[t]he  bag was also being pushed out by the contents and was close to full by the  volume of the contents.\" [9]     Detective Constable Hill believes Mr. Randhawa gave Mr. Pereira drugs at  this meeting and that the drugs were from #907-1221 Bidwell Street in Vancouver,  BC\u2014a location he believed was a stash site for the Kang group's drug trafficking  enterprise. Mr. Randhawa was believed to be one of the drug couriers for the  Kang group. Mr. Pereira was believed to be a member of the Red Scorpion group  and a close associate of Kyle Latimer, another co-accused on this indictment. On  the basis of the observations relayed and the believed associations, Detective  Constable Hill formed the belief that the drugs were exchanged between  Mr. Randhawa and Mr. Pereira and that Mr. Pereira had the drugs in  the beige backpack that was later put into the Dodge Durango driven by Mr. Szucs. [10]     After Mr. Pereira left Mr. Randhawa's Ford Fusion, he went to a Mercedes  vehicle registered in his name, put the backpack in the vehicle, and drove to  the Fairmont Pacific Rim Hotel, arriving 10 minutes later at 14:01 hours.  [11]     Video Clips 307 and 310, which are from the Fairmont Pacific Rim Estates,  depict Mr. Pereira with a beige backpack slung across one shoulder as he  strides through the lobby and with both straps of the backpack over his  shoulders as he waits at the elevator. A good view of that backpack can be seen  at approximately the 11-second mark of Video Clip 310 when Mr. Pereira is in  profile to the CCTV camera and the dimensions of the backpack are readily  apparent. A similar view of the backpack can be seen on Video Clip 71 at  approximately the 20-second mark. [12]     In cross-examination, Detective Constable Hill was unable to offer  comments about the heaviness of the backpack from Video Clip 310, but he did  say that in Video Clips 307 and 71, the backpack did not look that heavy. [13]     Defence seeks to have the videos admitted not to challenge Detective  Constable Hill's subjective grounds with respect to the arrest of Mr. Szucs but  to assist in determining the objective reasonableness of those grounds in so  far as the \u201cheaviness\u201d of the backpack is concerned after the meeting between  Mr. Randhawa and Mr. Pereira in the Ford Fusion at 13:48 hours.  [14]     The defence acknowledges that Detective Constable Hill did not see the video  clips at the time they were taken, and they did not form part of his grounds  for arrest. What did form part of his grounds was the surveillance team's  comments about the change in the weight and appearance of the bag after Mr.  Pereira concluded his meeting with Mr. Randhawa.  [15]     The defence argument appears to suggest that the video clips are  objective evidence about the actual state of the backpack that Mr. Pereira had  after his meeting with Mr. Randhawa and that an examination of the video clips  establishes that the backpack was not as described in the master surveillance  reports. The defence argues that this goes to the objective reasonableness of  Detective Constable Hill's grounds. [16]     In order for an arrest under s. 495(1)(a) of the  Criminal Code,  R.S.C.  1985 c. C-46 to be lawful, the arresting officer must subjectively believe  that there are reasonable grounds and those grounds must be objectively  justifiable:  R. v. Storrey , [1990] 1 S.C.R. 241 at 250\u2013251 as cited in  R.  v. Jir , 2010 BCCA 497 at para. 18 and  R. v. Luong , 2017 BCSC 1779 at  para. 46.  [17]     In  Luong  at paras. 50 and 51, Mr. Justice Bowden succinctly  summarized the concept of reasonable grounds and the objective standard: [50] As  cited in  Jir , in  R. v. Luong , 2010 BCCA 158, Madam Justice  Bennett stated: [24] The  assessment of whether objective grounds exist undertaken by a trial judge is  conducted by first looking at the observations of the officer (which the trial  judge has found as facts) through the lens of someone who has the same  experience, training, knowledge and skills as the officer who is making the  observations, and then deciding if a reasonable person with the same lens would  come to the same conclusion as the police officer\u2026 [51] The reasonable grounds standard  is less than the civil standard of proof and is one of reasonable probability  or reasonable belief. ( R. v. Debot , [1989] 2 S.C.R. 1140 and  Jir ).  It requires something more than mere suspicion that amounts to \u201c\u2026a practical,  non-technical and common sense probability as to the existence of the facts and  inferences asserted.\u201d ( Mugesera v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  Immigration) , 2005 SCC 40 at para. 141 and  R. v. Sanchez , (1994), 93  C.C.C. (3d) 357 at page 367, as referred to in  Jir ). [18]     The Crown asserts that because objective reasonableness or the objective  standard is assessed from the perspective of a reasonable person standing in  the shoes of Detective Constable Hill and Detective Constable Hill did not see  the videos at the time he formed his grounds, the videos are irrelevant to the  assessment of the grounds on the objective standard. [19]     I must, with respect, disagree. While I understand the point the Crown  makes, what is troubling in all of this is the fact that the videos of the  backpack do not show a heavy backpack or a backpack \u201cpushed out by the contents\u201d  and \u201cclose to full by volume of the contents\u201d.  [20]     In my view, where one officer is forming the grounds for arrest and is  relying upon the observations of the surveillance team, then the reporting of  the observations ought to be accurate. The video clips in Exhibit A might tend  to contradict the accuracy of the observations noted in the master surveillance  report as the observations were related to Detective Constable Hill by members  of the surveillance team at the time.  [21]     To that extent, in my view, the video clips are relevant. The weight to  be attached to the video clips may well be another matter. However, they appear  to be relevant and therefore are admissible for that purpose on the  voir  dire . \u201cKer J.\u201d",

David  Huntley Before:  The Honourable Mr. Justice Thompson Oral Ruling on  Charter  Voir Dire Counsel for the Crown: M. Halston Counsel for the Accused: M. Munro Place and Date of Hearing: Victoria, B.C. January 4-6, 2021 Place and Date of Judgment: Victoria, B.C. January 6, 2021   [1]     THE COURT:  Mr. Huntley is charged with possession of  heroin, fentanyl, and cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. This was a downtown  Victoria street arrest. A search incident to the arrest turned up the  controlled substances that are the subject of the charges. [2]     Constable Ewington is a Victoria City Police officer. He was on foot  patrol. He observed what he suspected to be a hand-to-hand drug transaction. He  and his partner of the day, Constable Tremblay, followed one of the persons who  engaged in this behaviour (later identified as Mr. Huntley) for two or  three blocks. The police officers then stopped Mr. Huntley for jaywalking.   [3]     During this detention, Cst. Ewington testified that he observed part of  a cylindrical tube in Mr. Huntley's rear pocket, and concluded that it was  pepper spray. He arrested Mr. Huntley for possession of a weapon. During  the search conducted incident to the weapon arrest, the tube was examined. It was,  in fact, an M&M candy container taped up. The controlled substances were in  this container. Mr. Huntley was then arrested for possession of controlled  substances. He was also issued a ticket for disobeying a pedestrian control  signal under s. 132(3) of the  Motor Vehicle Act . [4]     Counsel for Mr. Huntley filed a  Charter  notice. Mr. Huntley  argues that his detention for disobeying a pedestrian control signal was a ruse  in furtherance of a drug investigation. He argues that his detention was  unlawful and the searches that occurred during his detention were unreasonable.  He contends that the police infringed his rights under ss. 7, 8, and 9 of  the  Charter . If an infringement is found, Mr. Huntley will apply  under s. 24(2) to exclude from evidence the items seized during his  detention. [5]     Mr. Halston, during argument for the Crown, ably and concisely  summarized the law applicable to this type of case. If a detention has more  than one real purpose, multiple purposes may coexist without infringing  s. 9 of the  Charter :  R. v. Kaddoura , 2009 BCCA 113 at paras. 23-24;   R. v. Madill , 2005 BCSC 1564 at para. 26. On the other hand, it is  settled that the police cannot employ a lawful aim as a pretext to perpetuate  an unlawful aim:  R. v. Nolet , 2010 SCC 24 at para. 36. See also  R.  v. Dudhi , 2019 ONCA 665 at para. 91. The police cannot misuse their  enforcement powers under the  Motor Vehicle Act  in furtherance of a  criminal investigation:  R. v. Woody , 2018 BCSC 2275 at para. 40. [6]     The issue in this case comes down to one of fact. What was in Cst.  Ewington's mind when he first detained Mr. Huntley? For the reasons that  follow, I conclude that what Cst. Ewington had in mind was using the jaywalking  infraction as a pretext to detain Mr. Huntley so as to further the drug  investigation. Contrary to Cst. Ewington's evidence, I find that this was the  sole purpose of the detention. [7]     Cst. Ewington had about four years\u2019 of policing experience at the time  of the alleged offence, but when he was with the RCMP in Fort St. John for  three years he spent some of this time on a unit dedicated to investigating low-level  to mid-level drug trafficking activity. He testified that he had been involved  in hundreds of drug investigations before 1 April 2019, the date of the alleged  offences. Cst. Ewington was partnered with Cst. Tremblay, a police officer with  about 20 months' experience at that time. Cst. Tremblay had only a small amount  of experience investigating drug offences. The two police officers were doing  an overtime shift and were not regular partners. They had rarely, if ever,  worked together before. [8]     Their shift on 1 April 2019 started at 10:00 a.m. They were in uniform,  assigned to patrol the area around 900 block Pandora Avenue in downtown  Victoria. There is a homeless shelter and a safe injection site on that block. It  is an area where drug offences are frequently observed. At about 11:00 a.m.,  the two police officers were side by side as they approached the gated  courtyard area outside the homeless shelter and there were about 30 or 40  people congregated in that area. Mr. Huntley was in one group.  [9]     As the police officers entered the courtyard, Cst. Ewington testified he  saw a suspicious hand contact between Mr. Huntley and another man. Although  he did not see any items passed, the hands moving from pocket to contact, at  this location notorious for such transactions, caused Cst. Ewington to infer  that a drug transaction may have taken place. Neither participant in this  hand-to-hand contact were known to Cst. Ewington. Cst. Tremblay did not see  what Cst. Ewington described.  [10]     Someone in the courtyard said, \"Six up,\" a phrase warning  others that police were nearby. Mr. Huntley promptly left the courtyard. The  two police -- Mr. Huntley, you might want to stay awake for this. [11]     THE ACCUSED: I was listening. [12]     THE COURT: The two police officers had a brief conversation. Cst.  Tremblay told Cst. Ewington that the person who Mr. Huntley was in contact  with was Dustin McPhail. Cst. Tremblay told Cst. Ewington that he knew Mr. McPhail  as a person involved in the drug trade. Cst. Tremblay testified, and I accept,  that this was a \"quick little conversation\" that \"came to a  determination to follow Mr. Huntley [i.e. the person who was later  identified as Mr. Huntley] and see what happens.\" Cst. Tremblay  perceived that Cst. Ewington's plan was to catch up to Mr. Huntley and  stop him. [13]     Cst. Ewington testified that while at 919 Pandora Avenue he had formed  the grounds and the intention to arrest Mr. Huntley. He testified that it  was prudent for safety reasons to let Mr. Huntley separate himself from  the hundred or so people hanging around in the courtyard and outside of that  address before conducting the arrest. I accept that this plan to avoid an  arrest at that location would be very sensible, but, for reasons that I will come  to, I do not accept Cst. Ewington's evidence that he had formed grounds or the  intention to arrest Mr. Huntley at that point in time. [14]     The two police officers followed Mr. Huntley westbound on the south  side of Pandora Avenue. Mr. Huntley was walking but at a brisk pace. It is  a considerable distance to the end of this long city block, i.e. the 900 block  of Pandora Avenue, to the intersection with Quadra Street. Mr. Huntley then  crossed Quadra Street and continued westbound. The next block on Pandora Avenue  is also a very long one.  [15]     Based on Cst. Tremblay's evidence, I conclude that the police were  following Mr. Huntley at a distance of about 20 yards. While they were  following Mr. Huntley, Cst. Tremblay testified that nothing further was  said about the plan in relation to Mr. Huntley. Cst. Ewington was clearly  taking the lead and Cst. Tremblay assumed that Cst. Ewington's intention was to  stop Mr. Huntley at some point. While walking along, the police officers had  Mr. Huntley in sight. Cst. Tremblay was watching to see if Mr. Huntley  would do a shoulder check, or answer his phone, or try to dispose of anything. Apparently  no such behaviour was observed. [16]     Mr. Huntley walked along the entire length of the 800 block of  Pandora Avenue. I find that he crossed Blanshard Street at the end of that block  before turning left, that is, south. He walked the length of that block, too,  although it is a city block of a more usual length in downtown Victoria. By  this time, Cst. Tremblay estimated that the police were about a quarter-block  behind Mr. Huntley.  [17]     The police officers saw Mr. Huntley cross Johnson Street, in the  crosswalk. Johnson Street is at the end of that southbound block on Blanshard  Street. I accept Cst. Tremblay's evidence that Mr. Huntley crossed after  the pedestrian signal had turned from \"Walk\" to an indication not to  walk. The numbers were counting down to the time when the light for the  north-south traffic on Blanshard Street would turn amber.  [18]     On the basis of Cst. Tremblay's evidence I find that Cst. Ewington then said  to Cst. Tremblay, \"Okay, let's stop him now.\" Cst. Tremblay  testified that it was his impression that they were going to arrest Mr. Huntley  for what Cst. Ewington had observed back at 919 Pandora Avenue. I pause to say  that it is what was in Cst. Ewington's mind that matters, not what Cst. Tremblay  might have assumed that Cst. Ewington planned. [19]     The police officers quickened their pace to a light jog to catch up to Mr. Huntley,  and Cst. Ewington said to Mr. Huntley, \"Hey, it's Victoria Police,  just hang out there for a sec.\" Once Mr. Huntley stopped, and this  was partway down the next block on Blanshard Street heading southbound toward  Yates Street, Cst. Ewington said to Mr. Huntley, \"Hey, you just  jaywalked  \u2014 t hat's the  reason we're stopping you right now.\" Cst. Ewington asked Mr. Huntley  for identification and the events I recounted earlier in the introduction to  these reasons unfolded from there. [20]     As I said a moment ago, it is Cst. Ewington's intention as he effected  the detention that matters. He was taking the lead throughout, and Cst.  Tremblay, as he testified, was taking his cues from Cst. Ewington. My  assessment of the evidence, considered in the round, is that Cst. Ewington had  not decided to arrest for a  CDSA  offence when the police officers began  following Mr. Huntley. I think Cst. Ewington was suspicious, but had not  \u2014  contrary to his evidence  \u2014  concluded while at 919 Pandora Avenue  that Mr. Huntley was arrestable. As a police officer with some significant  drug investigation experience, I think Cst. Ewington knew that his observations  at 919 Pandora Avenue were thin and arguably insufficient grounds for a  CDSA   arrest. While he saw the suspicious conduct at a location with frequent drug  activity, and Cst. Ewington was told that Mr. McPhail was known to have  some involvement in the drug trade, it was a single hand-to-hand observation  with no items seen. I conclude that Cst. Ewington made the sensible decision to  follow Mr. Huntley and to observe him. I think he also had in mind  stopping Mr. Huntley to see if further evidence might be obtained.  [21]     I come to this conclusion after considering the surrounding  probabilities. I begin with the absence of reference in Cst. Ewington\u2019s report  to Crown Counsel to a decision to arrest being made while Cst. Ewington was at  919 Pandora Avenue. The narrative in this report authored by Cst. Ewington  gives no indication of this early subjective formation of grounds to arrest. [22]     My conclusion is also consistent with the actions of Cst. Ewington taken  with Cst. Tremblay in his wake. They followed Mr. Huntley for a  considerable distance without getting too close. Cst. Tremblay's evidence is  that they were still a quarter-block behind Mr. Huntley when he jaywalked.  During this walk, the police officers were following and observing, but taking  no steps to arrest Mr. Huntley despite soon being well away from the crowd  in the 900 block of Pandora Avenue. I am satisfied that the reason no steps  were taken to arrest was because Cst. Ewington had not formed the intention to  arrest while at 919 Pandora Avenue, or since they had left 919 Pandora Avenue.  They had seen nothing during the walk that had added anything to the evidence  against Mr. Huntley. [23]     My conclusion is also consistent with Cst. Tremblay's evidence that the  two officers had a \"quick little conversation\" and \"came to a  determination to follow Mr. Huntley and see what happens.\" The  notion of \"see[ing] what happens\" captures the essence of what Cst.  Ewington's intentions were  \u2014  as  opposed to a settled intention to pursue and arrest Mr. Huntley.  [24]     I conclude that Cst. Ewington's evidence is an inaccurate reconstruction  of what was in his mind during the time from when Mr. Huntley came to his  attention to the time that Cst. Ewington saw what he thought was a canister of  pepper spray. I find that Cst. Ewington's decision to stop Mr. Huntley for  crossing Johnson Street when the pedestrian countdown had already begun was reflected  in what he said to Cst. Tremblay: \"Okay, let's stop him now.\" This  stop was a pretext to try to gather more evidence in the midst of a  CDSA   investigation. [25]     This was not a dual-purpose stop like occurred in the  Kaddoura   case. I find that there was only one real reason for stopping Mr. Huntley.  The purpose of the stop was to attempt to secure further evidence in support of  the  CDSA  charge. In making this finding, I appreciate that Cst. Ewington  made reference to a \"dual purpose\" during cross-examination, but I  find that this was a reconstruction. Notably, this is not reflected by what he  said in his report to Crown Counsel where he asserts (contrary to my finding)  that the reason for the detention was an observed  Motor Vehicle Act   infraction.  [26]     I do not accept Cst. Ewington's evidence that grounds were formed while  at 919 Pandora Avenue and that one of the reasons for stopping Mr. Huntley  was to arrest him for a  CDSA  offence. I appreciate that this is what  Cst. Tremblay may have assumed would happen, but I find that the real reason  for the stop was to \"see what happens\" during a pretext stop. If one  of the reasons for stopping Mr. Huntley was, in fact, to arrest him for a  CDSA   offence, I think it highly likely that a drug investigator with some  experience like Cst. Ewington would have advised Mr. Huntley immediately  of the reason for his arrest as Cst. Ewington surely knew he was obliged to do  under s. 10(a) of the  Charter . [27]     In conclusion, the jaywalking stop was a pretext. In the event, it was a  productive ruse that resulted in the gathering of critical evidence in the drug  investigation. There is no doubt that the jaywalking stop was a detention, and  it was an unlawful detention because of the misuse of a lawful power as a  pretext to further the criminal investigation. The detention was therefore  arbitrary and an infringement of s. 9 of the  Charter . It follows  that searches conducted subsequent to the arbitrary detention were unreasonable  and infringed s. 8 of the  Charter .  \u201cThompson  J.\u201d",

Horswill,   2019 BCCA 2 Date: 20190111 Docket: CA44172 Between: Regina Respondent And Michael Scott Horswill Appellant Restriction on Publication: A  publication ban has been mandatorily imposed under   s. 486.4 of the  Criminal Code  restricting the publication,  broadcasting or   transmission in any way of evidence that could identify a complainant or  witness,   referred to in this judgment by the initials B.L.  This publication ban applies   indefinitely unless otherwise ordered. Section 16(4)  of the  Sex Offender Information and Registration Act : This section   provides that no person shall disclose any information that is collected  pursuant   to an order under  SOIRA  or the fact that information relating to a  person is collected   under  SOIRA . Before: The   Honourable Mr. Justice Harris The   Honourable Mr. Justice Savage The   Honourable Madam Justice Fisher On appeal from: Orders of the Supreme Court of British  Columbia,   dated January 9, 2017 ( R. v. Horswill,  2017 BCSC 35,   Prince George Registry 37592) and dated January 9, 2017,   ( R. v. Horswill , 2017 BCSC 160, Prince George Registry 37592). Counsel for   the Appellant: T.M. Arbogast Counsel for   the Respondent: L.A. Vizsolyi Place and   Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British Columbia September 24, 2018 Place and   Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia January 11, 2019   Written Reasons by: The Honourable Mr. Justice Harris Concurred in by: The   Honourable Mr. Justice Savage The Honourable Madam Justice Fisher   Summary: Appeal of a sentence of 14 months\u2019 incarceration imposed  after conviction for sexual interference with a four\u2011year\u2011old. Held:  appeal dismissed. Although the judge erred in his conclusion that the mandatory  minimum sentence imposed by s. 151 of the Criminal Code was  constitutional, he did not err in principle in concluding that on the facts of  this case a conditional sentence is not a fit sentence. No other error being  alleged, the Court defers to the sentence imposed by the judge. Reasons for Judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice  Harris: [1]     This is a companion  case to  R. v. Scofield , indexed as 2019 BCCA 3, which  also engaged the constitutionality of the mandatory minimum sentence in  s. 151(a) of the  Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C\u201146. In   Scofield , this Court found, on the basis of a reasonable hypothetical  and the particularized inquiry as it applied to that case, that s. 151(a)  was unconstitutional and of no force or effect. [2]     While the  constitutional result applies in this case, the facts here are different to  those in  Scofield . [3]     In brief, Mr. Horswill  was convicted of sexual interference with a four\u2011year\u2011old girl, B.L.,  who was his family friends\u2019 daughter. He was in his mid\u2011forties at the  time of the offence. On July 16, 2013, Mr. Horswill spent the day  with B.L.\u2019s family at a lake. He chose to spend the night with B.L.\u2019s family at  their cabin, and his wife returned home. B.L.\u2019s father and Mr. Horswill  shared a bed. At some point during the night, Mr. Horswill got out of bed  and went to the bedroom shared by B.L. and her younger brother. He picked up B.L.  and took her downstairs to the bathroom where he removed her pajamas and diaper  and sat her on his lap. He put hand soap on his fingers and digitally  penetrated her vagina and anus. She testified that the experience was painful  and that she cried quietly so she would not wake her brother. Mr. Horswill  stopped when B.L. asked him to. He told her not to tell anyone or she would get  in trouble. He returned her to her bedroom. She told her parents what had  happened the next day. [4]     The judge sentenced Mr. Horswill  to 14 months\u2019 imprisonment in addition to a term of probation and other  ancillary orders. [5]     On this appeal, Mr. Horswill  concedes that the length of the sentence falls within the applicable range and  does not challenge it on appeal. The focus of his appeal, so far as the non\u2011constitutional  issues are concerned, is that the judge erred in finding a conditional sentence  order (\u201cCSO\u201d) was not warranted, irrespective of its unavailability in face of  the mandatory minimum sentence. [6]     The essential facts  on which Mr. Horswill relies in support of his argument are: \u00b7   Mr. Horswill  was born in Nelson, B.C., and has two brothers. \u00b7   His  upbringing was stable and caring. \u00b7   He has  been married for over 24 years. \u00b7   He and  his wife have two children. \u00b7   Mr. Horswill  and his wife have lived in the same community since 1996. \u00b7   They  recently sold their home, partly to address the issue of not wanting to see the  complainant family. \u00b7   Mr. Horswill  served in the Canadian Armed Forces after high school. \u00b7   After  receiving an honourable discharge, he worked at C.P. Rail for two years and  attended Selkirk College in Nelson. \u00b7   He  then took a job as an Application and Contract Sales Engineer for two years at  Modern Systems Management and then for five years at Entegrated Systems  Consultants Ltd. \u00b7   He  relocated to his current community and started a company in 1996. He and his  wife became its sole owners in 2004. By 2005, the company employed 15\u201120  people in the area. \u00b7   In  2013, they sold the company but Mr. Horswill remained an employee until  January 2016 when convicted. He and his wife started another enterprise shortly  thereafter, which subcontracts to their former company. Currently, he works  mostly from home. \u00b7   Mr. Horswill  is a pilot and frequently updates his training. \u00b7   His  wife stated that the conviction has devastated the family but they have rallied  behind him. \u00b7     Mr. Horswill  began attending counseling in February 2016 to address the stress in his life. [7]     In addition, Mr. Horswill  relies on letters from his family and friends reflecting his honesty,  integrity, good character, his commitment to his family (both close and  extended), and the devastating emotional and financial consequences for both  him and his family resulting from the conviction. [8]     As counsel wrote in  his statement on sentence: [13] \u2026  Mr. Horswill presented as a well-liked, respected and stable citizen and  family man, and was an upstanding member of [his] community, with no prior  criminal record. It is fair to say that the conviction and sentence were  devastating to him, his business and his family. The trial judge acknowledged  that a prison term would be difficult for him. [Citations  omitted.] [9]     The judge addressed  the potential availability of a CSO in his reasons, indexed as  R. v. Horswill ,  2017 BCSC 35 (unreported): [58] Mr. Horswill,  in his submissions, relies upon the proposition that, but for the minimum  sentence provision, he would be permitted to serve his sentence by way of a  conditional sentence, and thus the mandatory minimum has the effect of  preventing him from being able to access a valid and effective alternative  sentence. [59] In  my respectful view, a conditional sentence is not a viable alternative to a traditional  in\u2011custody carceral sentence, notwithstanding that bar. This is not a sentence  which should which could be served in the community. While I am well aware of  the line of authority commencing with  R. v. Proulx , 2000 SCC 5  accepting that a conditional sentence order, properly fashioned, can, in many  situations, adequately meet the objectives of denunciation and deterrence, in  the facts of this case, I would not be prepared to accept that a conditional  sentence order could adequately serve those purposes of sentence in this case.  I note that the authorities quite resolutely indicate that conditional sentence  orders are not appropriate in offences of this nature, and also that at least  one other  Criminal Code  provision precludes the availability of a  conditional sentence in a matter of this nature: s. 742.1 (c)  prohibits the imposition of a conditional sentence where the offence, when prosecuted  by way of indictment, has a maximum term of imprisonment of fourteen years. [10]     The judge\u2019s last statement  was a mistake because the offence did not have a maximum term of imprisonment  of 14 years. At the time of the offence, the maximum term was 10 years. [11]     Mr. Horswill  contends the judge erred in principle when he asserted the authorities \u201cquite  resolutely indicate that conditional sentences are not appropriate for offences  of this nature\u201d. He argues the judge wrongly treated this offence as a category  of offence for which a CSO is not available in principle. To the contrary,  conditional sentences have been imposed for offences of this nature when  considered appropriate in the right circumstances. [12]     I accept that there is no absolute and categorical rejection of the  availability of conditional sentences for offences such as sexual interference,  unless eliminated by operation of the  Code  itself. Whether such a  sentence is appropriate turns on the specific circumstances and whether, in all  of the circumstances of the case, the criteria established in  R. v. Proulx ,  2000 SCC 5, are met. Importantly, a CSO must be consistent with the  principles of sentencing, which, in a case of this kind, gives primacy to  denunciation and deterrence. [13]     Sentencing judges  are accorded significant deference absent an error in principle affecting the  sentence or the sentence being demonstrably unfit:  R. v. Agin ,  2018 BCCA 133 at para. 54. Considering whether a CSO was a fit sentence  formed part of the judge\u2019s sentencing analysis. While the judge\u2019s rejection of  a CSO appears in his reasons for judgment regarding the constitutional question  (indexed as 2017 BCSC 35) as opposed to the reasons for sentence (indexed as  2017 BCSC 160), his decision to reject a CSO forms part of his overall  determination of a fit sentence. Absent an error in principle, the sentencing  judge\u2019s decision to reject a CSO is entitled to deference. [14]     In  R. v. Safaee ,  2009 BCCA 367, this Court rejected the availability of a CSO in a case  involving two incidents of sexual assault of a six\u2011year\u2011old. In the  words of Madam Justice Bennett: [21] The  child attended the daycare operated by the appellant\u2019s wife. She had been  attending the daycare since she was one year old. The appellant occasionally  looked after the children when his wife was not at home, and on this occasion  his wife was in Iran. The child also stayed over at the appellant\u2019s home when  her parents were out of town. The relationship was one of trust, and  significant trust.  [22] The  appellant has many factors operating in his favour. He is 51 years old and  has no criminal record. He pleaded guilty to the charge. He is an engineer by  training and works in the construction industry. He has suffered shame and has  shown remorse. He has been married for 26 years and has two sons, one in  high school and one in university. He had many letters of character reference  from members of the community. All of this evidence was carefully considered by  the sentencing judge. [23] The  effect of the offence on the victim and her family is severe. A Victim Impact  statement was filed and sets out the trauma experienced by the child and her  mother. [24] The  appellant\u2019s rehabilitation may be achieved by taking a sex offender treatment  program while on a conditional sentence.  [25] However,  the principles of deterrence and denunciation will not be achieved by a  conditional sentence. This is an offence of a most serious breach of trust.  Parents who deliver their children to the care of other people are entitled to  be secure in the knowledge that their children are safe and will not be  sexually assaulted by those who are entrusted with their care. The moral  blameworthiness of the appellant is high. In  Proulx , the court stated at  para. 102. [102] Denunciation is the  communication of society\u2019s condemnation of the offender\u2019s conduct. In  M. (C.A.) ,   supra , at para. 81, I wrote; In  short, a sentence with a denunciatory element represents a symbolic, collective  statement that the offender\u2019s conduct should be punished for encroaching on our  society\u2019s basic code of values as enshrined within our substantive criminal  law. As Lord Justice Lawton stated in  R. v. Sargeant  (1974),  60 Cr. App R. 74, at p. 77: \u201csociety, through the courts, must  show its abhorrence of particular types of crime, and the only way in which the  courts can show this is by the sentence they pass\u201d. Incarceration  will usually provide more denunciation than a conditional sentence, as a  conditional sentence is generally a more lenient sentence than a jail term of  equivalent duration. That said, a conditional sentence can still provide a significant  amount of denunciation. This is particularly so when onerous conditions are  imposed and the duration of the conditional sentence is extended beyond the  duration of the jail sentence that would ordinarily have been imposed in the  circumstances. I will discuss each point in turn. [26] Deterrence  and denunciation can be achieved in some cases by a conditional sentence order.  However, it would be the rare case where these principles are appropriately  addressed by a conditional sentence in a case involving sexual assaults  committed by a daycare operator on a vulnerable child. [15]     Safaee  does not categorically rule out  conditional sentences. It indicates that they will rarely be available in cases  of sexual assaults against vulnerable children involving significant breaches  of trust by an adult. As always, a principle stated in a case must be read in  light of the facts giving rise to it.  Safaee  makes clear that, for an  offence of this gravity, a CSO will likely be available only in exceptional circumstances.  Nonetheless, each case must be considered in light of all of the pertinent  circumstances. [16]     In this case, I do  not think the judge premised his reasoning on a categorical rejection of the  availability of a CSO. Rather, his conclusion was reached in the context of the  particular circumstances of the case. I read the critical parts of the impugned  reasoning as concluding that,  on these facts , a CSO is not available  because it will not satisfy the criteria established in  Proulx .  Moreover, his statement that courts resolutely conclude that a CSO is unavailable  for offences  of this nature  is a means of capturing the constellation of  circumstances that make this case similar to others in which conditional  sentences were unavailable. As such, his statement is consistent with and  captures the thrust of this Court\u2019s reasoning in  Safaee . In substance,  the judge is explaining why, on the facts of this case (as with comparable  cases), a CSO is unavailable. [17]     As a result, I am  not persuaded that the judge erred in principle in rejecting a CSO. The judge  was aware of the relevant facts. No error is alleged in respect of his  appreciation of the evidence. In particular, the judge was alive to Mr. Horswill\u2019s  personal circumstances including the challenges of a prison sentence.  [18]     The reasons  carefully analyzed the relevant sentencing principles involving sexual  interference with a young child. Those principles place primary weight on  denunciation and deterrence. The judge also examined the facts carefully. In  summarizing his reasoning, he said: [62] In  determining what would properly constitute a fit sentence for Mr. Horswill  in this situation, I must take into account that, while there was one incident  only, the assault upon this child was serious and invasive. The victim was  vulnerable in that she was only four years of age; she was sleeping in her own  bed in her own home when this occurred. [63] \u2026 I am  satisfied that there was an element of trust that must be ascribed to the  position in which Mr. Horswill found himself. While this was not the  classic situation of a caregiver to whom a child\u2019s welfare had been  specifically entrusted, he was a trusted friend of the family and, on that  basis, had been welcomed into their home. It was in that circumstance that he  had access to this child. [64] Additionally,  I am satisfied that the offence has had a serious and harmful effect upon the  child, as well as on her parents, and the family dynamic. The long-term effects  for the child are not known at this time, but there is at least a reasonable  basis to be concerned that she may experience some repercussions. [65] As  for Mr. Horswill, I have to take into account that he is an individual who  has never before had any dealings with the criminal justice system. He has no  criminal record. He must be considered, for the purpose of this exercise, an  individual of good character. The many letters filed on his behalf attest to  that. [19]     The judge referred  to the many cases with which he had been provided before concluding that a fit  sentence for Mr. Horswill was in the range of 12 to 18 months: [74] The  sentence range I have set out takes into account the specific nature and  circumstances of the offence and the fact that Mr. Horswill is a  first-time offender of otherwise good character. It is informed by a  consideration of the other case decisions to which I have been referred and the  relevant  Criminal Code  provisions dealing with sentencing. [20]     Accepting the  gravity of the offence, there were no sufficiently exceptional circumstances to  justify a CSO. Even though Mr. Horswill is a person of good character,  there are no mitigating circumstances that would serve to reduce his moral  culpability to the degree necessary to make a CSO a reasonable sentence. As the  judge observed, there is no apparent explanation why Mr. Horswill  committed the offence. [21]     In the result, the  judge did not err in principle in rejecting the availability of a CSO on the  facts of this case. [22]     Mr. Horswill  does not argue the sentence is demonstrably unfit and he accepts that his 14\u2011month  sentence is within an acceptable range of sentences for this type of offence.  [23]     Accordingly, I would  dismiss the appeal. It is not necessary to engage with the judge\u2019s reasoning on  the mandatory minimum sentence, since those issues are addressed in  Scofield .   \u201cThe Honourable Mr. Justice Harris\u201d I  agree: \u201cThe Honourable Mr. Justice Savage\u201d I  agree: \u201cThe  Honourable Madam Justice Fisher\u201d",

Danjou,   2019 BCCA 16 Date: 20190115 Docket: CA45782 Between: Regina Respondent And Tejwant Danjou Applicant   Restriction  on publication: A publication ban has been mandatorily imposed under s. 517(1)  of the  Criminal Code  restricting the publication, broadcasting or  transmission in any way of the evidence taken, the information given, or the  representations made and the reasons, if any, given or to be given by the  justice presiding over the application for judicial interim release (bail).     Direction of the  Chief Justice on an Application for Review   Pursuant to Section 680 of the  Criminal Code of Canada . Counsel for the Applicant: D. Turko, Q.C. S.L. Dawson Counsel for the Respondent: M. Lefebure S. McCallum Written Submissions of the Applicant Filed: December 13, 2018 and    January 7, 2019 Written Submissions of the Respondent Filed: January 4, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 15, 2019     Summary: The applicant is charged  with second degree murder in relation to the death of his common-law partner. He  applied for release pending trial and his application was dismissed. He now  applies for a direction from the Chief Justice that the decision be reviewed by  a division of this Court. Held: Application dismissed. It is not arguable that  the chambers judge committed material errors of fact or law, or that the  decision was clearly unwarranted. Reasons for Judgment of the Honourable  Chief Justice Bauman: [1]     Tejwant Danjou seeks an order under s. 680 of the  Criminal Code ,  R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 to direct the Court of Appeal to review a bail  decision made by Beames J. on 27 September 2018. [2]     For the following reasons, I find that the bail judge did not arguably  commit any material errors of fact or law. Nor is it arguable that the decision  was clearly unwarranted in the circumstances. As a result I dismiss the  application. [3]     A publication ban applies to this case under s. 517 of the  Code .  The s. 517 ban prohibits the publication, broadcast or transmission in any  way of the evidence, information and representations at the bail hearing and  the bail judge\u2019s reasons. The ban will expire when the trial ends. Until then,  reasons for judgment on this review application and any subsequent review  decision should not be published. [4]     Mr. Danjou is charged with the second-degree murder of Rama  Gauravarapu, with whom he had been in a common-law relationship since 2015. The  Crown alleges that Mr. Danjou and the victim had been on a winery tour,  got in an argument, then returned separately to the hotel. The Crown alleges Mr. Danjou  beat the victim, then fled. The victim was pronounced dead at the scene and Mr. Danjou  was found shortly thereafter in a dumpster. [5]     At trial Mr. Danjou expects to raise defences including  intoxication, diminished capacity, provocation, and non-insane automatism. [6]     The bail judge denied the application for bail pending trial. [7]     The bail judge summarized the events surrounding the offences as  follows: [2] The victim was killed on July 22, 2018, at the  Best Western Hotel in West Kelowna. On autopsy, she was found to have suffered  over 50 injuries, including multiple blows to the head, a cut jugular vein, and  defensive wounds on her hands. There was extensive blood splatter in the room  in which she was killed, on the floor and the walls and small amounts on the  ceiling. Some of the blood splatter was observed to contain human tissue. [3] Crown counsel has provided a detailed review of  the circumstances alleged by Crown which I will not set out in full. Suffice it  to say that there is evidence that the accused and the victim had been on a  winery visit earlier in the day, that is on July 22, 2018. They were, according  to Crown's submissions, seen to have an argument or arguments of some sort and  left the winery in separate cabs. On return to the hotel which they had checked  into the previous day, the accused checked into a second room. He then left the  hotel to get cigarettes and apparently to visit the Greyhound bus depot to make  inquiries about taking a bus to the Lower Mainland.  [4] He returned to the hotel and was seen on  surveillance video to enter the room then occupied by the victim. A short while  later, guests in the room immediately below the victim's room reported hearing  loud noises and a staff member went to the door of the room. She thought she  heard a fight happening inside the room and so, concerned about her safety, she  went to get extra help. When she found her co-worker was busy, she returned to  the room and knocked. A male inside initially refused to open the door,  rejecting any assistance on her part, but when she persisted, the door was  opened and she was able to see a woman, lying on the floor, with swollen eyes,  in what appeared to be a lot of blood. The woman appeared to be having  difficulty breathing and asked the staff person to call the police. The man  inside the room said, \"Don't call the police. She doesn't need help\". [5] The employee,  according to the statement she has provided to this point in time, backed out  of the room, returned to the lobby and called 9-1-1. By the time the police  attended, the man had fled. He was found, with the assistance of a police dog,  in a dumpster a relatively short distance from the hotel. The accused was  assisted from the dumpster, arrested and transported to the hospital. By this  time, the paramedics had responded to the victim and had pronounced the victim  to be dead. [8]     The bail judge acknowledged that because Mr. Danjou was accused of  second degree murder, the burden lay on Mr. Danjou to show why his  detention was not justified:  Code , s. 522(2). [9]     The bail judge concluded Mr. Danjou had met his burden in respect  to the primary and secondary grounds for detention. The bail judge concluded Mr. Danjou\u2019s  ties to the community meant he was not a risk of failing to attend court. The  bail judge also concluded that detention was not required to protect the public  or prevent Mr. Danjou from committing further offences. [10]     The bail judge thus focused on the tertiary ground: whether further  detention was \u201cnecessary to maintain confidence in the administration of  justice\u201d:  Code , s. 515(10)(c). The bail judge considered this  provision in light of the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s guidance in  R. v.  St-Cloud , 2015 SCC 27. The section provides that detention is justified: (c) if the detention is necessary to maintain  confidence in the administration of justice, having regard to all the  circumstances, including (i) the apparent strength of the prosecution\u2019s case, (ii) the gravity of the offence, (iii) the circumstances  surrounding the commission of the offence, including whether a firearm was  used, and (iv) the fact that the accused  is liable, on conviction, for a potentially lengthy term of imprisonment or, in  the case of an offence that involves, or whose subject-matter is, a firearm, a  minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of three years or more. [11]     The bail judge considered the four factors outlined in s. 515(10)(c)  and concluded that the Crown\u2019s case was \u201cvery strong\u201d despite the defences Mr. Danjou  purported to raise, that the offence is \u201cvery grave\u201d, that the offence was  \u201cviolent\u201d and that if convicted, Mr. Danjou could face life imprisonment. The  bail judge acknowledged that these four factors are not exhaustive, and at para.  15 of her reasons, the bail judge considered that the ultimate question was  whether  detention is necessary to  maintain confidence in the administration of justice from the perspective of a  reasonable person properly informed who is not a legal expert and not  necessarily able to appreciate the subtleties of the various defences available  to the accused. [12]     This paragraph echoed  St-Cloud \u2019s guidance that s. 515(10)(c)  requires considering whether a reasonable member of the public would continue  to have confidence in the administration of justice: [ 79 ] Thus, a reasonable member of the  public is familiar with the basics of the rule of law in our country and with  the fundamental values of our criminal law, including those that are protected  by the Charter. Such a person is undoubtedly aware of the importance  of the presumption of innocence and the right to liberty in our society and  knows that these are fundamental rights guaranteed by our Constitution. He or  she also expects that someone charged with a crime will be tried within a  reasonable period of time, and is aware of the adage that \u201cjustice delayed is  justice denied\u201d:  R. v. Trout , 2006 MBCA 96, 205 Man. R.  (2d) 277, at para. 15. Finally, a reasonable member of the public knows  that a criminal offence requires proof of culpable intent ( mens rea ) and  that the purpose of certain defences is to show the absence of such intent. A  well-known example of this type of defence is the mental disorder defence. The  person contemplated by s. 515(10)(c)  Cr. C . therefore  understands that such a defence, once established, will enable an accused to  avoid criminal responsibility. However, it would be going too far to expect the  person in question to master all the subtleties of complex defences, especially  where there is overwhelming evidence of the crime, the circumstances of the  crime are heinous and the accused admits committing it. [ 80 ] In  short, the person in question in s. 515(10)(c)  Cr. C.  is  a thoughtful person, not one who is prone to emotional reactions, whose  knowledge of the circumstances of a case is inaccurate or who disagrees with  our society\u2019s fundamental values. But he or she is not a legal expert familiar  with all the basic principles of the criminal justice system, the elements of  criminal offences or the subtleties of criminal intent and of the defences that  are available to accused persons. [13]     The bail judge concluded that Mr. Danjou had not met his burden and  so declined to order his release. [14]     Mr. Danjou submits that the bail judge erred in principle by  improperly considering what the perspective of a reasonable person properly  informed per  St-Cloud  must be. Mr. Danjou submits that the public  would be sympathetic to individuals who may have had a break with reality or  have diminished capacity. Mr. Danjou further submits that the bail judge  erred by finding the expected defences were too complicated for the public to  understand. Mr. Danjou also submits that the tertiary ground is reserved  for cases that \u201cshock the community\u201d and that the four factors in s. 515(10)(c)  do not reach \u201ctheir highest levels\u201d in his case. [15]     The Crown submits the bail judge made no errors, and that the impugned  language from the bail judge reflects  St-Cloud . The Crown also submits,  as it submitted at the bail hearing, that there is no evidence to support the  defences raised by Mr. Danjou. Finally, the Crown submits that Mr. Danjou  mistakes the scope of the tertiary ground and that  St-Cloud  necessitates  a far more liberal reading. [16]     Section 680(1) of the  Code  reads:  680 (1) A decision made by a  judge under section 522 or subsection 524(4) or (5) or a decision made by a  judge of the court of appeal under section 261 or 679 may, on the direction of  the chief justice or acting chief justice of the court of appeal, be reviewed  by that court and that court may, if it does not confirm the decision, (a) vary  the decision; or (b) substitute  such other decision as, in its opinion, should have been made. [17]     The Supreme Court of Canada interpreted s. 680 in the context of  bail pending appeal in  R. v. Oland , 2017 SCC 17.  Oland  describes  that the threshold for directing a review is whether it is arguable that the bail  judge committed material errors of fact or law, or whether the impugned  decision was clearly unwarranted in the circumstances. The parties have not  argued that  Oland  applies differently in the context of bail pending  trial, as is the case here, so I will proceed with the analysis on the basis  that  Oland  applies in the same manner to bail pending trial as bail  pending appeal. [18]     I do not find it arguable that the bail judge committed material errors  of fact or law and do not see the bail judge\u2019s decision as clearly unwarranted.  The bail judge correctly identified the offence as grave and correctly assessed  the potentially lengthy incarceration facing Mr. Danjou. Mr. Danjou has  not shown that the bail judge misconstrued his likelihood of success at trial,  nor has Mr. Danjou pointed to any error in the bail judge\u2019s assessment of  the evidence. [19]     I do not view the bail judge as resting her decision on whether a  reasonable member of the public could not understand the subtleties of the  defence; rather, the bail judge was simply reiterating the  St-Cloud  test.  The bail judge assessed the expected defences as overly weak, not as overly  subtle. Mr. Danjou does not assert that the bail judge fundamentally  misunderstood or underestimated the strength of the defences he sought to  raise, and I have been given no reason to question the bail judge\u2019s assessment  of the probability of conviction. [20]     As for the submission that the tertiary ground is limited to cases that  would shock the community, it is simply incorrect. As  St-Cloud  explains  at para. 87: \u00b7     Section 515(10)(c)  Cr. C.  does not create a  residual ground for detention that applies only where the first two grounds for  detention ((a) and (b)) are not satisfied. It is a distinct ground that itself  provides a basis for ordering the pre-trial detention of an accused. \u00b7     Section 515(10)(c)  Cr. C.  must  not be interpreted narrowly (or applied sparingly) and should not be applied  only in rare cases or exceptional circumstances or only to certain types of crimes. [21]     The bail judge made no arguable error of fact or law in her  consideration s. 515(10)(c). [22]     I take Mr. Danjou\u2019s submission that the four factors of s. 515(10)(c)  do not reach the \u201chighest levels\u201d to argue that even if the bail judge had  properly considered the law, Mr. Danjou\u2019s detention was \u201cclearly  unwarranted\u201d under  Oland . Under  Oland , for the bail judge\u2019s  decision to be clearly unwarranted, it must be a decision that no reasonable  bail judge could have made:  R. v. Poony , 2017 BCCA 447 at para. 29.  I do not see the bail judge\u2019s overall exercise of discretion to reach this high  standard. Disposition [23]     For these reasons, I dismiss Mr. Danjou\u2019s application to direct a  review. \u201cThe Honourable Chief Justice Bauman\u201d",

Central   Park Developments Ltd.,   2021 BCSC 119 Date: 20210107 Docket: S2012660 Registry:  Vancouver Between: Peninsula (Kingsway)  Seafood Restaurant Inc. Petitioner And Central Park  Developments Ltd. and Fraser Healthy Authority Respondents Before:  The Honourable Mr. Justice Macintosh Oral Reasons for Judgment Counsel for the Petitioner: C.R. Rubinstein Counsel for the Respondent, Central Park Developments Ltd.: A.P. Morrison Counsel for the Respondent, Fraser Healthy Authority: N. Lapper E. Moore, Articled   Student Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, B.C. January 4, 2021 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, B.C. January 7, 2021   [1]     The Petitioner, Peninsula (Kingsway) Seafood Restaurant Inc. (\u201cPeninsula\u201d),  was the commercial tenant of premises at 4555 Kingsway in Burnaby. It applies  for relief from forfeiture. The landlord, the Respondent, Central Park  Developments Ltd. (\u201cCentral Park\u201d), lawfully terminated the lease on the ground  that Peninsula had not paid rent on time. Central Park has now accepted an  offer to lease the same premises from the Respondent, Fraser Health Authority  (\u201cFraser Health\u201d).  [2]     The parties have agreed to an 11-page statement of facts, including a  letter signed by Central Park and Fraser Health on December 17, 2020, removing  their subject conditions from the offer to lease. I attach as Schedule A to  these reasons, as forming part of these reasons, the agreed statement of facts,  including the letter. One should read Schedule A before proceeding to read the  balance of these reasons. [3]     Peninsula relies on s. 24 of the  Law and Equity Act , R.S.B.C.  1996, c. 253. It says simply that: The court may relieve against all  penalties and forfeitures, and in granting the relief may impose any terms as  to costs, expenses, damages, compensations, and all other matters that the  court thinks fit. [4]     Sechelt Golf & Country Club Ltd. v. District of Sechelt , 2012  BCSC 1105 at paras. 138 and 139, sets out factors to be applied and considered  in deciding whether the party in default ought to be granted relief from  forfeiture. Those paragraphs provide as follows: [138] Relief from forfeiture is a purely discretionary  remedy. No party is entitled to this relief as of right. Saskatchewan River Bungalows Ltd. v. Maritime Life  Assurance Co. , [1994] 2 S.C.R. 490 at 504 (S.C.C.) [139] A summary of the applicable principles to be  considered in deciding whether SGCC ought to be granted relief from forfeiture  on the facts of this case include: (a) whether the sum forfeited is  out of all proportion to the loss suffered ( Pope v. Potter , 2011 BCSC  697 at para. 23); (b) whether it would be  unconscionable in the traditional equitable sense for relief not to be granted  ( Pope  at paras. 24-25); (c) the applicant\u2019s conduct, the  gravity of the breaches and the disparity between the value of the property  forfeited and the damage caused by the breach ( Saskatchewan River Bungalows   at 504); (d) whether there are any  collateral equitable grounds which exist including the party coming to court  with \u201cunclean hands\u201d ( 600433 B.C. Ltd. v. XJ Motors Ltd. , 2011 BCSC 1144  at para. 34); (e) whether the applicant is  \u201cprepared now to do what is right and fair, but must also show his past record in  the transaction is clean\u201d ( Snell\u2019s Equity  (29th ed., 1990) at 31 and  541-542.). See also:  British Columbia Development Corporation v. NAB  Holdings Ltd.  (1986), 6 B.C.L.R. (2d) 145 (C.A.). [5]     I note that when Justice Abrioux, as he then was, in  Sechelt  set  out factors (a) to (e), he described them specifically in the context of the Sechelt  Golf & Country Club, in a case where there was no third party interest such  as there in this case because of Fraser Health. Perhaps it can be said that  \u201ccollateral equitable grounds\u201d in (d) from  Sechelt , quoted above, takes  into account a third party lease interest, although I expect such an interest  would have received more explicit recognition in  Sechelt  had it been  present in the facts of that case. The presence of Fraser Health\u2019s interest as  the prospective new tenant alters the analysis, and must be added as a  significant factor to the five factors listed in  Sechelt , assuming that  \u201ccollateral equitable grounds\u201d in factor (d) from  Sechelt  is not  intended to address third party leasehold interests. [6]     The Respondents submit that the accepted offer to lease is determinative  of the matter, such that the Court must not exercise its discretion, and is  therefore without discretion, to grant the relief against forfeiture that is  being requested. Alternatively, the Respondents appear to accept that the  accepted offer to lease is at least a significant factor against the relief  being granted, as I have found it to be. [7]     The following three cases, two from this province, address the relevance  of a third party lease interest in applications for relief from forfeiture.  [8]     Justice Locke, as a member of this Court, said, as  dicta , in  Gleneagle  Manor Ltd. v. Finn's of Kerrisdale Ltd. , [1980] B.C.J. No. 94 (S.C.) at  para. 37: [37] The principle running through the cases is that if the  landlord can be compensated in money,  and there are no intervening third  party rights , a Court will at least consider the matter.  [Emphasis added.] [9]     His Lordship\u2019s comment about intervening third party rights was brief, I  expect because nobody in that case had acquired any third party rights, the  absence of which His Lordship treated as a factor in favour of the tenant who  was seeking relief from forfeiture. [10]     The Saskatchewan Court of Queen\u2019s Bench had to consider third party  lease interests more fully in a case where the landlord had accepted a third  party\u2019s offer to lease in  H.S.H. Restaurant Inc. v. Lakeview Mall Inc. ,  [1986] S.J. No. 197. The Court refused to grant the tenant relief from  forfeiture, relying heavily on the third party lease interest after having  considered the applicable law as follows at paras. 18-20 of the decision: [18] Although relief from forfeiture is a discretionary  matter and falls within the equitable jurisdiction of the court, certain  principles have evolved through the decisions of the courts. Generally, unless  there are exceptional circumstances, the court will grant relief from  forfeiture when arrears of rent and costs have been paid. See:  Hunt ling v.  MacAdam , [1908] W.L.R. 214; 13 B.C.R. 426; and  Gill et al. v. Lewis et  al , [1956] 2 Q.B. 1. However, in the case of  Stanhope v. Haworth , 3  T.L.R. 34, the court held that the tenant was not entitled to relief from  forfeiture where the application for relief was made almost six months after  default judgment and possession, during which time the position of the landlord  had altered since he kept up the colliery at his expense and other parties had  paid out money in purchasing the plant and were now in possession. [19] In the case of  Newbolt v. Bingham et al , 72  L.T.R. 852, at p. 853, Lord Esher, M.R., stated the law to be as follows: If, at the time relief is asked  for, the position has been altered, so that relief could not be given without  causing injury to third parties. I think that the case that was cited to us ( Stanhope  v. Haworth ) applies . But if, at the time of the application, the  position is not altered, so that no injustice will be done, I think, if the  conditions mentioned in the section are complied with, that, according to the  settled practice in equity, there is no longer a discretion in the judge, but  that he ought to make the order. It does not matter whether it is called  discretionary or not, if the discretion ought always to be exercised in one  way. If the conditions are complied with,  and no interests of third parties  have intervened , there is no longer any real discretion in the matter. [20] In the case of  Gleneagle Manor Ltd. et al. v.  Film\u2019s of Kerrisdale Ltd. et al  (1981), 116 D.L.R. (3d) 617, Lock, J.,  reviewed numerous authorities and then at p. 627 stated: The principle running through the  cases is that if the landlord can be compensated in money,  and there are no  intervening third party rights , a court will at least consider the matter. [Emphasis added.] [11]     Finally, I refer to  600433 B.C. Ltd. v. XJ Motors Ltd. , 2011 BCSC  1144. There Justice Burnyeat, after finding that the Court retained the  discretion to grant relief against forfeiture, even though the interests of a  third party had intervened (see para. 45), refused to grant the relief, and  cited as one of his grounds for the refusal the fact that the property had been  re-let. Quoting in part from para. 54 o\u2019f Justice Burnyeat's reasons: [54] I have also concluded that  relief from forfeiture should not be granted because the Property has been  re-let. The presence of the New Lease would result in XJ being obligated to pay  considerable damages if this new tenant was required to give up vacant  possession in order that the Plaintiff could go into occupation again \u2026 [12]     Returning to the agreed facts, amplified slightly by me based on the  filed affidavit evidence, one sees that Peninsula has been persistently late in  its obligation to pay rent over the three and a half years of the lease,  including in the years and months before COVID-19. [13]     Central Park, throughout, acted as a reasonable and relatively  accommodating landlord, entering a lease amendment in June 2018 to postpone  Peninsula\u2019s obligation to pay basic rent, another lease amendment in April of  2020 to give Peninsula another postponement of rent, and a rent deferral  agreement in July of 2020 again serving to postpone Peninsula\u2019s rent  obligations. Central Park issued a default of rent notice in the fall of 2018,  again in the summer of 2020, and finally in October of 2020. The rent defaults  themselves were numerous (see agreed statement of facts, Schedule A, paras. 16,  19, 21, 22, 29, 35, 40, 46 and 50). [14]     Central Park lawfully terminated the Peninsula lease on October 16,  2020. It wrote to Peninsula and the two \u201cindemnifiers\u201d (essentially guarantors)  on October 23, 2020, as follows: To Whom It May Concern: Further to our Notice of Termination issued to you on October  16, 2020, we understand that you have communicated with our bailiff  representative and have requested to pay the arrears of rent and reinstate the  Lease. We hereby advise you that the Landlord will not reinstate the  Lease. We acknowledge your communications with the bailiff, but,  respectfully, the time to have communicated with us and preserve the Lease was  after we issued to you the Notices of Default, and not now after the  termination of the Lease has been issued. We confirm that we provided to you  three Notices of Default, after all of which we received no reply. Unfortunately, we no longer have confidence in the ability of  the Tenant to pay the rent on an ongoing, timely basis, nor confidence that the  establishment will be open for profitable business in the near future. We also note that there is no longer any value in the  covenants of the Indemnifiers of the Lease. The current state of the covenants  of the Tenant and the Indemnifiers, and the failure of the Tenant to pay rent  on time and communicate with us after the Notices of Default, have resulted in  our decision to terminate and not re-instate the Lease. We did not take this decision  lightly, and will be as cooperative as possible with you, but in the foregoing  context. For clarity, you remain responsible for payment of the  arrears of rent, the enforcement expenses of the Landlord, and losses  associated with the Landlord losing the benefit of the Lease over the unexpired  portion of the Term. We are proceeding to re-lease the Premises to mitigate our  damages, as required under law. This letter is without prejudice  to any of our rights, powers, privileges, remedies and defences, now existing  or hereafter arising, all of which are hereby expressly reserved. [15]     On October 26, 2020, Peninsula advised that it wanted to stay at the  premises. It notified Central Park of this application on November 9, and filed  this petition on November 26. The matter was to be heard December 17, but I  gather no judge was available then. [16]     Central Park, having lawfully terminated the Peninsula lease on October  16, 2020, accepted the November 2   offer to lease from Fraser Health  on November 13. As noted earlier, Central Park and Fraser Health, on December  17, 2020, removed the subject conditions from the offer to lease. Fraser Health  obtained legal occupancy of the premises on January 1, 2021. Fraser Health  presented detailed evidence in the affidavit of Lenia Calico filed December 14,  2020, demonstrating the importance of this site, given its particular location  in Burnaby, its street access, and its size, in order for Fraser Health to  establish a large primary care facility. It appears from the evidence that such  sites are not readily available. The lease term with Fraser Health is 10 years. [17]     Before returning to the five criteria, or factors, in  Sechelt ,  listed earlier in these reasons, I note that Central Park has little practical  recourse against Peninsula for future rent arrears or other costs or expenses  incurred from this somewhat difficult tenancy. Peninsula, although a BC  company, has no assets in BC, or apparently elsewhere, and is not in good  standing with the Registrar of Companies. The two indemnifiers or guarantors  for Peninsula are, or were, BC companies, but they have been struck from the  registry or are not in good standing. [18]     The evidence is that whenever Peninsula has been placed in funds to pay  Central Park, those funds have come in from China. In other words, in this  province, Peninsula is judgment-proof. [19]     Although a number of the criteria from  Sechelt  lend some support  to Peninsula on this application, as I will address below, I have concluded  from all of the facts, and in particular the now unconditional accepted offer  to lease from Fraser Health, that the application for relief from forfeiture  must be denied. Where, as here, a landlord has lawfully terminated a lease and  then lawfully entered into a  bona fide  and substantial lease arrangement  with an innocent third party, there is a compelling case for allowing the third  party rights to trump the wishes of the original tenant in default. Further, it  appears at this stage that Fraser Health has the lawful right to sue Central  Park if Central Park reneges on the new lease, where damages could be  substantial. The Court\u2019s discretion should not ordinarily be exercised so as to  subject a party in Central Park\u2019s position to third party claims where that  party, Central Park, has acted lawfully and reasonably throughout. [20]     Turning to the  Sechelt  criteria, Peninsula will have substantial  costs thrown away, very roughly, in the range of $2 million expended on rent  and improvements for a restaurant it never opened. Under factor (b), however,  it cannot be unconscionable in equity to deny relief where, as here, a landlord  acting lawfully and reasonably has engaged the substantial lawful interests of  a third party. [21]     Under factor (c), Peninsula\u2019s conduct has been that of a tenant  persistently demonstrating that it is reluctant to meet its rent obligations,  and often doing so only when forced to. Many of its emails vying for time for  delayed rent are masterpieces for leading a creditor along without quite  amounting to bad faith or evidence of unclean hands. Now that the lease has  been terminated, Peninsula has been generous in offering to immediately pay the  relatively small outstanding rent arrears, and to deposit approximately  $450,000 toward future rent payments. I have spoken earlier about collateral  equitable grounds in criterion (d) as possibly including third party interests.  Whether Fraser Health\u2019s interests are to be weighed under that criterion or  separately, they are, as I have indicated, the interests that tip the scale on  this application against Peninsula. Under  Sechelt  criterion (e), while I  would not conclude that Peninsula has unclean hands, it has not been a diligent  tenant at any stage in the course of the lease term. [22]     Were it not for the presence of the Fraser Health lease interest, I  would, with reluctance, have allowed relief from forfeiture. In my view,  however, the Fraser Health lease is the overwhelming factor toward the  conclusion that I should dismiss Peninsula\u2019s application, which I do. [23]     I thank counsel for their helpful submissions. \u201cMacintosh  J.\u201d Schedule A  ",

Mau, Christina  Mau Nowik, Joanna Mau Nowik   and Diana Mau Financial Corporation Plaintiffs/   Defendants by Counterclaim And G.A. Consulting  Services Inc.   Katie Mak Accounting Corp. and   Diana Mau Corporation Defendants/   Plaintiffs by Counterclaim Before:  The Honourable Mr. Justice Macintosh Oral Reasons for Judgment Counsel for Plaintiffs/Defendants by Counterclaim: S.M. MacKenzie Counsel for Defendants/Plaintiffs by Counterclaim: J.K. Bienvenu Place and Date of Trial: Vancouver, B.C. January 7, 2020  Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, B.C. January 7, 2020    [1]     These brief reasons address the Defendants\u2019 argument that the Plaintiffs\u2019  case is not suitable for disposition by summary trial. The Plaintiffs\u2019 summary  trial application was set for today and scheduled for one day only. [2]     Having heard the Plaintiffs\u2019 review of the evidence and facts for most  of this morning, and in part this afternoon, and now having also heard the  parties\u2019 submissions as to suitability, I have concluded in the circumstances  set out below, notwithstanding Mr. MacKenzie\u2019s able submissions, that it  would be unjust to proceed further by summary trial in this complex case, and  that the Plaintiffs\u2019 summary trial application ought not to proceed further. [3]     The three personal Plaintiffs are a mother, who is an accountant, and  her two daughters, who, with their mother, are the three shareholders in the  mother\u2019s accounting business. [4]     By a share purchase agreement, the three personal Plaintiffs were to  sell their shares in the accounting business to the first two named Defendants.  The Plaintiffs now sue primarily for non-payment on the sale of their shares,  but additional relief is also sought. The Defendants defend and counterclaim  because they allege the first Plaintiff, Ms. Mau, failed to deliver to the  Defendants the accounting clients she had allegedly promised to deliver,  refused to sign a consulting agreement, and otherwise breached the share  purchase agreement. [5]     Counsel for both sides agree that the written share purchase agreement  is \u201cfar from perfect\u201d in its clarity. In addition to the share purchase  agreement itself, the case requires the consideration of draft agreements, oral  agreements, and the Plaintiffs\u2019 claim for rectification of clause 3.2(a) in the  share purchase agreement in accordance with para. 23 pleaded in the  amended notice of civil claim. [6]     There are two practical considerations which form an important part of  the basis for my conclusion. [7]     First, in my view, the summary trial application could not conclude in  only one day. Two days would be required, and I believe even that would be a  tight estimate. By midday today, the Plaintiffs had not quite concluded their  review of the evidence and facts, and had not begun their legal submissions. The  suitability submissions only began at about 12:15 midday. They continued at  2:00 p.m. The Defendants\u2019 case on the merits has not yet begun. I add that the Plaintiffs\u2019  review of the evidence and facts has progressed as far as it has only because Plaintiffs\u2019  counsel, who is fully on top of his brief, packed an enormous amount of complex  information into the time he had. I should add too, as another reality, that I  am hearing another matter tomorrow, and I am then away until January 27th,  followed by other court commitments on my return. [8]     The second practical point is that the parties have reserved a five-day  trial for this matter beginning in approximately two months, that is, on March  9, 2020. [9]     From the time  Inspiration Management  was decided by our Court of  Appeal in 1989, this Court has proceeded to employ the summary trial rules  robustly.  [10]     However, there clearly are cases, of which this is one, where the Court  would be greatly assisted by hearing from the key witnesses. When it is kept in  mind that five trial days are available just two months from now, I believe it  would be unjust not to hear from those witnesses in the hope of turning complex  facts into facts that are more readily understandable. In particular, as one  example, a judge will want to have a better understanding of whether both sides  were properly performing their obligations around the consulting agreement,  whether written or oral. [11]     I am mindful of the cost of a five-day trial, but the sums at issue here  are not trivial, and the pretrial steps, including several discoveries, have  already occurred. [12]     The remainder of these reasons are subject to the directions of the  trial judge, who may disagree with and override what I set out below depending  on her or his assessment as the case nears trial. [13]     I recommend that counsel, with my support, seek a case management  conference before the judge who will hear the trial. [14]     I also recommend that the trial be a hybrid trial, so that evidence is  introduced by both affidavit and oral evidence. The three volumes of materials  before me today would form part of the evidentiary record. In addition, each  side could call one witness, probably Ms. Mau for the Plaintiffs and Ms. Fong  or Ms. Mak for the Defendants. [15]     I will ask Mr. MacKenzie to keep my copy of the three volumes of  evidence used today and give them to the trial judge as her or his copy to use  at trial if the judge decides to proceed as I have recommended above. [16]     Costs of today are costs in the cause. \u201cMacintosh  J.\u201d",

Outerbridge Settlement of the  Contents of the Respondents\u2019 Appeal Books Reasons for decision  from: An order of the Supreme Court of British Columbia,   dated August 3, 2021 ( Masjoody v. Trotignon , 2021 BCSC 1502,   Vancouver Docket S204587).  Oral Reasons for Decision The Appellant, appearing in person (via videoconference): Dr. M. Masjoody Counsel for the Respondents (via videoconference): Y. Li-Reilly Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British   Columbia February 1, 2022 Place and Date of Decision: Vancouver, British   Columbia February 1, 2022   Summary: Settlement of the respondents\u2019 appeal books by the  Registrar in an appeal challenging an order dismissing the appellant\u2019s claim  for want of jurisdiction. The appellant sought the removal of a pleading,  various affidavits, and other documents from the respondents\u2019 appeal books. Held:  The appellant\u2019s application is dismissed. The challenged material was properly  within the respondents\u2019 appeal books. REGISTRAR  OUTERBRIDGE :  [1]     The appellant, Dr. Masjoody,  applies to settle the contents of the respondents\u2019 appeal books. He seeks the  removal of a pleading, certain affidavits, and other documents on the basis  they were not before the chambers judge or are not necessary to resolve the  issues on the appeal. [2]     Dr. Masjoody  was a doctoral student and instructor with Simon Fraser University (SFU) in the  Department of Mathematics. He was dismissed in 2020. [3]     During his  employment, he alleges that he suffered bullying, discrimination, harassment,  defamation, and \u201cconspiracy to defamation.\u201d These claims gave rise to his  notice of civil claim filed in April 2020. Many of these claims relate to the  conduct of a colleague, Ms. Trotignon, but also involve other SFU  employees as described within his notice. Paragraph 7 of the amended notice of  civil claim states: As  of late August 2019, defendants together engaged in defamation and conspiracy  campaigns against me, based on fabricated and false claims initially made by  Trotignon against me concerning her personal relationship with me and other  claims regarding Trotignon\u2019s personal relationship with me that were fabricated  by Mishna and Kropinski and distributed by, and on behalf of, the defendants. [4]     Dr. Masjoody alleges  that these \u201ccampaigns\u201d were in retaliation to a report he sent to SFU\u2019s  administration which he says details the engagement of the university with  certain persons affiliated with the Islamic Republic of Iran. [5]     On the basis that  these and other claims advanced should be adjudicated by the Labour Relations  Board under the terms of Dr. Masjoody\u2019s collective agreement, the  respondents successfully struck out his amended notice of civil claim for want  of jurisdiction on 3 August 2021. On 17 August 2021, Dr. Masjoody appealed  that order to this Court.  [6]     In attacking the  chambers judge\u2019s order, Dr. Masjoody argues the judge narrowed the dispute  between the parties to one that centered on his employment relationship, which  he characterizes very differently. In a broadly drawn factum, he argues the  chambers judge should have considered a narrower or different set of facts,  misconstrued facts, and otherwise made errors in her analysis which led to the  striking of his claim. He also alleges several procedural irregularities.  [7]     With respect to the  respondents\u2019 appeal books, he argues material has been included within that is  unnecessary and: (1) relevant to another application seeking to enjoin him from  publishing certain material (an application that was resolved by consent); or (2)  relevant to an \u201cabuse of process\u201d argument that was, in the end, not considered  by the judge.  [8]     The records at issue  are: a)     The notice of civil  claim, filed on 30 April 2020 (not the version amended on 25 June 2021);  b)     Dr. Masjoody\u2019s  affidavit #3, which appends and describes communications with several SFU  staff, including the former Chair of the SFU mathematics department; c)     Three exhibits to an  affidavit of the respondents\u2019 counsel\u2019s legal assistant, containing: i.     Dr. Masjoody\u2019s  response to a Human Rights complaint launched by a faculty member;  ii.     An email sent by Dr. Masjoody  to the SFU mathematics department, describing a dispute concerning the  assignment of grades for one of his courses;  iii.     Social media and  other publications between 26 October 2020 and 20 January 2021; d)     Four legal  assistants\u2019 affidavits attaching various social media posts and other  publications; and e)     An unfiled document,  entitled \u201cTimeline of Plaintiff\u2019s (Masood Masjoody) Social Media and Email  Publications January 14, 2020, to April 5, 2021.\u201d [9]     The legal test for  the inclusion of records in an appeal book was restated in  Iser v. Attorney  General of Canada,  2017 BCCA 358 (Registrar): [2] An  appeal book is prepared in accordance with Rule 26 and Form 12. The completion  instructions for Form 12 provide that the parties must include within their  appeal book \u201conly so much of the evidence, including exhibits, affidavits and  other documents, as is necessary to resolve the issues raised on appeal.\u201d The  language of Form 12 encourages counsel to reduce the size of the appeal book by  ensuring: a)  Records within the appeal books are \u201cevidence\u201d before the chambers judge. As I  discuss further below, this means records listed in the notice of application  or application response, included in the application record, or otherwise  placed before the chambers judge; and, b) Records  within the appeal books are necessary to resolve the issues raised on appeal.  In other words, the records are connected to the issues advanced or responded  to within the appeal, usually within the parties\u2019 factums. [10]     Justice Finch (as he  then was) also described the discretion to be exercised by the Registrar in  settling appeal books in  Re Fuller  (1995), 59 B.C.A.C. 303. In that  case, although under an earlier set of rules, he emphasized the importance of  establishing both the relevance of the documents to the subject matter of the  appeal and their necessity of their inclusion. The current Form 12 uses only  the term \u201cnecessary\u201d but presumably, irrelevant records will also be  unnecessary. [11]     I turn now to  considering the impugned documents:  a)     The Notice of  Civil Claim:  One of Dr. Masjoody\u2019s  arguments on the appeal is that the chambers judge wrongly referred to his  notice of civil claim rather than the amended version. Both are referred to in  the chambers judge\u2019s reasons and the parties\u2019 factums. To understand whether Dr. Masjoody\u2019s  argument has merit and any prejudice arose, the Court will also need to see  both. I do not agree with Dr. Masjoody\u2019s position that an appeal book  cannot, within limits, contain documents other than affidavits or exhibits:  Achtymichuk  v. Bayer Inc. , 2021 BCCA 393 at para. 9 (Registrar). I find the  original notice of civil claim is necessary and properly included in the  respondents\u2019 appeal book. b)     Affidavit #3 of Dr. Masjoody:  This affidavit contains narrative and  exhibits relevant to Dr. Masjoody\u2019s various communications with SFU staff.  In particular, it contains details relating to exchanges between Dr. Masjoody  and Dr. Kropinski, the then Chair of the SFU mathematics department. The  relationship between Dr. Masjoody and Dr. Kropinski and other staff  members are detailed within Dr. Masjoody\u2019s amended notice of civil claim,  his factum, and are described by the chambers judge in her reasons,  particularly at para. 75. This affidavit, along with others elsewhere in  the record, contain facts relevant to how the judge characterized the conduct  of Dr. Masjoody and others forming part of his claim. For these reasons,  this affidavit is also necessary and properly included in the respondents\u2019  appeal book. c)     Affidavits and  Exhibits Relating to Social Media Posts:  In her reasons, the chambers judge described several of Dr. Masjoody\u2019s  social media posts. She relied upon them to provide \u201c\u2026 further  details of the nature and subject matter of his dispute with the defendants\u201d: at  para. 58. Again, these posts provide needed context to understand the  conduct of Dr. Masjoody and others, facts that are central to the judge\u2019s  conclusions about the essential character of Dr. Masjoody\u2019s claim. As the  judge stated at para. 76: \u201cAll of these affidavits,  along with the  Internet postings , concern Dr. Masjoody\u2019s persistent and escalating  allegations of harassment and improper conduct of SFU employees toward him in  relation to his employment at SFU and his reputation within the SFU community\u201d  (my emphasis). As I explained, Dr. Masjoody is free to argue those conclusions  are in error, but the Court should have these exhibits in the record to provide  context to ground those arguments. These affidavits are also necessary and  properly included in the respondents\u2019 appeal book. d)     Social Media  Posts Timeline:  This  document was prepared as a litigation aid to help the chambers judge understand  the timing of Dr. Masjoody\u2019s social media posts. The respondents point to  a section of Dr. Masjoody\u2019s factum, where he alleges that the chambers  judge relied excessively on the respondents\u2019 version of the facts and questions  whether the judge read the material before her: at para. 57. They say this  document is required to establish the context of the submissions that they  made, showing where they directed the judge\u2019s attention. Written submissions are  normally excluded from an appeal book, and the question here is whether there  is a \u201cgood reason\u201d to include them:  Van Mol (Guardian ad litem of) v.  Ashmore  (1997), 86 B.C.A.C. 60 aff\u2019d 88 B.C.A.C. 262 at para. 3;  Achtymichuk .  In my view, there is. Though the documents do not contain \u201cargument\u201d  per se ,  Dr. Masjoody\u2019s challenge to the judge\u2019s reasoning process is so broadly  cast that the Court should see this document for the reason the respondents  suggest. This document is also necessary and properly included in the  respondents\u2019 appeal book. [12]     I would dismiss the  relief sought under Dr. Masjoody\u2019s appointment.  [13]     As the respondents  have been successful, they are entitled to their ordinary costs. \u201cT.R.  Outerbridge, Registrar\u201d",

Appellants (Respondents) And 0892868  B.C. Ltd. Respondent (Respondent  by Counterclaim) Before: The Honourable Madam Justice Newbury The Honourable Mr. Justice Groberman The Honourable Mr. Justice Abrioux On appeal from: Orders of  the Supreme Court of British Columbia, dated   August 14 and 16, 2019 ( Liapis v. Keshow , Vancouver Registry E162841).  Counsel for the Appellants: H.M. Dale Counsel for the Respondents: P.R. Albi, Q.C. S.E. Ovens Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 15, 2020 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 28, 2020   Written Reasons of the Court   Summary: Trial judge in family law  case, being dissatisfied with expert evidence concerning the value of a major  asset, ordered that the property be sold before she made a final order for the  division of property. This order had not been sought by counsel for either  party and they had not had the opportunity to make submissions on the  possibility of such an order. Appeal allowed. Trial judge had erred in making  the order without hearing counsels\u2019 submissions thereon, and she had not  considered other alternatives that might be preferable. Order for sale was set  aside and the case was remitted to the Supreme Court.  Reasons  for Judgment of the Court: [1]     We are all of the view that this appeal should be allowed and that the  trial in the court below should resume \u2013 if possible, before the trial judge  who has already heard several days of trial. If that is not possible, the Chief  Justice of the Supreme Court will have to nominate a new trial judge under R. 22\u20112(10)  of the  Supreme Court   Family Rules .  [2]     The order under appeal was made in the course of a family law trial in  which it became necessary to determine the value of a piece of real estate. The  real estate is located in downtown Vancouver and consists of a large  commercial/residential building called the \u201cBoulder\u201d. It is owned by the  respondent King Tiger Investments Ltd. (\u201cKing Tiger\u201d), a subsidiary of the  respondent 0880881 B.C. Ltd. (the \u201cNumbered Company\u201d), the shares of which are  owned by Mr. Keshow (the \u201chusband\u201d). He is involved in a time-consuming  and complex project to re\u2011develop the property.  [3]     A joint expert report on the fair value of the Boulder had been filed at  trial; the claimant in this proceeding, Ms. Liapis (the \u201cwife\u201d), had  disagreed with it; and she sought to adduce into evidence the opinions of two  other experts. In general terms, the experts disputed the method of calculating  the cost of the planned redevelopment of the Boulder, in respect of which the  husband had successfully reached a \u201cHeritage Revitalization Agreement\u201d with the  City of Vancouver. The Agreement included the grant to King Tiger of so-called  \u201ctransferable density\u201d rights. According to the husband\u2019s testimony, the terms  of the Agreement prohibit the sale of the building without the City\u2019s approval.   [4]     The trial commenced in October 2018 but was adjourned to February 2019  and then to early April 2019. On the 17th day of trial, both parties had filed  written submissions on the legal issues that had to be resolved. The husband  sought the equal division of the parties\u2019 family assets and submitted that  there was no need to \u201cforce a liquidation of one of the party\u2019s companies\u201d,  citing  Blackett v. Blackett  (1989) 63 D.L.R. (4th) 18 (B.C.C.A.) at 23\u20135.  Counsel for the wife submitted that \u201ceverything about the Boulder project\u201d was  \u201cspeculative\u201d and as we read his argument, suggested that the Court should  determine the fair market value at $4.1 million, the amount for which a  tenant of the Boulder property had made an offer to purchase. There may be  legitimate objections to using this tenant\u2019s offer as indicative of fair market  value. [5]     At the end of the day on April 5, 2019, the trial judge asked  counsel for the husband if she would require more time \u201cnext time we meet\u201d.  Counsel replied that she had \u201ca great deal more submissions\u201d to make, but that  she had finished her submissions explaining the table of assets she had  provided to the Court. [6]     When the trial resumed on August 14, the judge told counsel she had  had time to \u2018cogitate\u2019 over the summer and had come to some decisions. The  second of these was that because she saw \u201csubstantial deficiencies\u201d in the  expert reports, the only way she could be \u201cconfident in a fair value to be  assessed is by ordering the building to be sold.\u201d No further reasons were  given; nor did the judge explain why the Boulder itself was to be sold rather  than the husband\u2019s shares of the Numbered Company or the Numbered Company\u2019s  share of King Tiger. [7]     The husband\u2019s original notice of appeal was filed on August 28,  2019.  [8]     On September 5, 2019, the trial judge stayed the order of sale and  an ancillary order pending the husband\u2019s appeal. The trial was also adjourned  pending appeal. [9]     On October 30, 2019, Mr. Albi on behalf of the wife wrote to  counsel for the husband as follows: Considering the issue of proportionality and having regard to  the timelines before trial arguments are concluded,  we do not consider it  expedient or in the best interests of either party for the subject appeal to  proceed .  While our position is that the  Order for Sale is appropriate having regard to the valuation evidence before  the court, in order to address concerns raised in the appeal, we will advise  the trial judge that the continuation of the trial in November that  Ms. Liapis  is prepared to agree to vacate the Order for Sale to allow the trial arguments  to be concluded before judgment is rendered on all issues . In our view,  this will allow full argument on whether an Order for Sale should be granted,  and will render the appeal of the Order for Sale unnecessary. [Emphasis added.]   Strangely, counsel for the husband did not accept this  offer, apparently because she regarded it as offering only a \u2018suspension\u2019 of  the order for sale and believed that it was \u201ctoo late\u201d to get a \u201cfair\u201d solution  from the trial judge.  [10]     It is unfortunate that counsel misunderstood Mr. Albi\u2019s offer,  especially since in this court, both counsel acknowledged that neither party  had been afforded the right to be heard on the issue of whether the Boulder  should be sold before the judge divided the parties\u2019 property. The sale of the  Boulder was at best premature; and  if  some division becomes necessary  under the  Family Law Act,  a better method might well be to re\u2011allocate  corporate shares rather than to sell the property itself. Obviously, shares can  be divided in a way real estate cannot, and various taxes and fees, as well as  negotiations with the City, might be avoided. [11]     In the circumstances, we are of the view that the sale order and the  ancillary order should be set aside. The only remaining question for this court  is whether it will be necessary to order a new trial or whether the trial can  simply continue before the trial judge. This is complicated by the fact that  the judge has announced she is retiring effective May 30, 2020.  [12]     Ms. Dale argued initially before us that the trial judge had  breached the rules of procedural fairness in making the sale order without  hearing full argument on the issue from counsel and that her client should not  be required to go back before a judge who has \u201cmade her mind up\u201d on the  question of sale. Counsel referred us to a number of cases, including  Boury  v. Iten  2019 BCCA 81. In that instance, a judge in chambers had made an  (interlocutory) order in respect of which he had received written submissions  but had not heard oral argument from counsel. This court ruled that the judge  had thereby breached the rules of procedural fairness. In Tysoe J.A.\u2019s  words:  \u2026 The legal argument to be set  out in the Notice of Application is not intended to be a substitute for oral  submissions or more elaborate written arguments permitted by R. 8\u20111(16)  in the event the hearing of an application will take more than two hours. Two  of the valuable functions of oral advocacy are to answer questions the judge  may have and to phrase submissions in a persuasive fashion that may be slightly  different from legal arguments set out in the Notice of Application or written  submissions. [At para. 32.] Since it was not \u201cplain and obvious\u201d the procedural error  had not affected the outcome, the Court remitted the application to the Supreme  Court for a new hearing. (At paras. 44\u20135; see also  Felker v. Felker   [1946] O.W.N. 368 (Ont. C.A.);  Investors Group Financial Services Inc.  v. Corby  2005 BCSC 666.)  [13]     We are concerned here, however, with an interlocutory order made by a  trial judge mid-trial. As we told Ms. Dale, this court often refers  matters back to trial judges after correcting errors of law or fact. It is  assumed the trial judge will proceed without any predisposition against the  successful appellant. This was not an instance in which a truly discretionary  order was made that might justify a litigant in perceiving a predisposition on  the judge\u2019s part. (Ms. Dale confirmed she was not alleging bias on the  part of the trial judge, in which event cases such as  Malton v. Attia   2016 ABCA 130 would have been relevant.) [14]     In our discussions with counsel, Ms. Dale conceded that as long as  the trial judge was aware of the \u201ccorrect test\u201d applicable to the question of  when a sale of property such as the Boulder is required under the  Family Law  Act , S.B.C. 2011, c. 25, an order of this court remitting the matter  to the trial judge would be an appropriate \u201cremedy\u201d. Mr. Albi was also  content to have the question of sale determined by the trial judge  at the  end of trial,  not as a means of determining value but as a method of  dividing it between the parties after proper argument. [15]     It is obvious, in our view, that the sale order and the ancillary order  should not have been made until the trial judge had heard counsels\u2019 submissions  and considered all relevant factors under the  Family Law Act , including  whether a sale of the real estate would affect the Heritage Revitalization  Agreement and rights related thereto, the advantages and disadvantages to each  of the parties, and (if a division  is  found to be necessary) whether an  apportionment of corporate shares might be a preferable alternative. Further,  we note that while valuation issues are often difficult, trial judges must at  the end of the day do the best they can with the evidence they have. As stated  by this court in  Cyprus Anvil Mining Corp. v. Dickson  (1986) 33 D.L.R.  (4th) 641: The one  true rule is to consider all the evidence that might be helpful, and to  consider the particular factors in the particular case, and to exercise the  best judgment that can be brought to bear on all the evidence and all the  factors. I emphasize: it is a question of judgment. No apology need be offered  for that. Parliament has decreed that fair value be determined by the courts  and not by a formula that can be stated in the legislation. [At 652.] [16]     In the result, we would allow the appeal, set aside the sale order and  the ancillary order, and remit all outstanding issues to the trial judge for  determination. We acknowledge that it may not be possible for her to hear this  matter before her retirement, in which case the Chief Justice of the Supreme  Court will have to cconsider making an order under   R. 22\u20112(10)  of the  Supreme Court Family Rules , and a new judge will have to  determine how to conduct the trial under R. 22\u20112(11).   \u201cThe Honourable Madam Justice Newbury\u201d  \u201cThe Honourable Mr. Justice Groberman\u201d  \u201cThe Honourable Mr. Justice Abrioux\u201d",

Brown,   2022 BCSC 154 Date: 20220112 Docket: M-1810511 Registry:  Vancouver Between: Samantha Knowles Plaintiff And Christopher  Alexander Brown, Shane Lloyd Brown (Lessee)  and Dueck  Chevrolet Buick Cadillac GMC Ltd. (Lessor) Defendants Before:  The Honourable Justice Blake Oral Reasons for Judgment     In Chambers Counsel for the Plaintiff     appearing by teleconference: G.J. Collette Counsel for the Defendants     appearing by teleconference: D. Lavoie Place and Date of Trial/Hearing: Vancouver, B.C. January 12, 2022 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, B.C. January 12, 2022   [1]     THE COURT:  The plaintiff applies pursuant to s. 10 of the  Law  and Equity Act , R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 253, or alternatively pursuant to  either Rule 9-6 or 9-7 of the  Supreme Court Civil Rules , B.C.  Reg. 168/2009, for an order for judgment in the terms of the defendants'  offer to settle dated October 6, 2021, which was accepted by the plaintiff on  October 8, 2021. She also seeks an order that the defendants pay to the  plaintiff the costs of the action to October 6, 2021, assessed in accordance  with Rule 14-1 of the  Supreme Court Civil Rules .  [2]     Both of these orders are necessary to authorize the Registrar to assess  the plaintiff's bill of costs, and neither are objected to by the defendants.  [3]     However, the plaintiff also seeks an order that the costs of the action  be assessed by the Registrar without application of s. 5 of the  Disbursements  and Expert Evidence Regulation , B.C. Reg. 210/2020, which the defendants  object to. [4]     There is no dispute by the parties on the relevant underlying facts. By  way of brief background, the underlying action arises from injuries the  plaintiff sustained in a motor vehicle accident on October 6, 2017. The notice  of trial in this action was filed on July 7, 2020, and the trial was scheduled  to be heard on October 12, 2021, for 19 days. On October 6, 2021, the defendants  served an offer to settle on the plaintiff pursuant to Rule 9-1 of the  Supreme  Court Civil Rules,  which the plaintiff accepted unconditionally by letter  dated October 8, 2021 (the \u201cSettlement\u201d).  [5]     The material terms of the Settlement are as follows: The plaintiff will be entitled to payment by the defendants  of $520,000 (the \u201cSettlement Payment). The parties will be entitled to  costs in accordance with this offer to settle (the \u201cSettlement Costs\u201d). The plaintiff has executed the necessary release and has  received the Settlement Payment.  [6]     The Settlement contained the following term with respect to the Settlement  Costs:  The plaintiff is entitled to her  costs of this action at Scale B, and necessary and reasonable disbursements to  the date of the delivery of this offer assessed in accordance with Rule 14-1 of  the  Supreme Court Civil Rules. There was no express mention of the  Disbursements  and Expert Evidence  Regulation ; however, the appropriate  interpretation of the phrase \"assessed in accordance with Rule 14-1 of the   Supreme Court Civil Rules\"  is the issue before me.  [7]     The parties disagree on the application of the  Disbursements and  Expert Evidence Regulation  to the bill of costs of the plaintiff: a)   the plaintiff  takes the position that because it was not specifically referenced in the offer  to settle it should have no effect on the assessment of her bill of costs. They  argue that as the offer said \u201ccosts assessed in accordance with Rule 14-1\u201d, only  Rule 14-1 should apply, and the  Disbursements and Expert Evidence Regulation   should not have any application;  b)   the defendants  say that as the  Disbursements and Expert Evidence Regulation  has been in  force in British Columbia since February 12, 2021, any assessment of a bill of  costs pursuant to Rule 14-1 of the  Supreme Court Civil Rules  after that  date would be subject to that legislation. They take the position that there  was no need for that law to be specifically referenced in the offer to settle,  as it was the law in force at the time that would have to be applied by the Registrar  in assessing the plaintiff's bill of costs. [8]     The issue before me is whether a Registrar assessing a bill of costs in  a vehicle injury action pursuant to Rule 14-1 of the  Supreme Court Civil  Rules , after the  Disbursements and Expert Evidence Regulation  came  into force, is required to apply the provisions of the  Disbursements and  Expert Evidence Regulation  in their assessment of the plaintiff's costs and  disbursements. [9]     By way of background, the  Disbursements and Expert Evidence  Regulation  came into force on February 12, 2021, and s. 5 applies to  the assessment of disbursements in a vehicle injury proceeding (whether damages  are assessed by the court or an offer to settle the proceeding is accepted).  [10]     The plaintiff referred me to the decision of  Walsh v. Walsh , 2018  BCSC 199, in which Justice Riley rendered judgment in an application to enforce  an agreement, and specifically one specific term in the agreement. In the  Walsh   decision, Justice Riley set out a procedure for resolving settlement agreement  disputes, and in particular when the court is asked to interpret and give  effect to the agreement. I agree with Justice Riley that I have the authority  to give effect to an agreement pursuant to s. 10 of the  Law and Equity  Act  (see para. 22).  [11]     The issue before me is an interpretation one. The Settlement makes clear  the parties agreed that \u201cThe plaintiff is entitled to her costs of this action  at Scale B, and necessary and reasonable disbursements to the date of delivery  of this offer,  assessed in accordance with Rule 14-1 of the  Supreme Court  Civil Rules . \u201d (emphasis added). Absent any other agreed terms in  a settlement, such an assessment of costs and disbursements must be in  accordance not only with the  Supreme Court Civil Rules,  but all other  applicable legislation and case law relevant to the determination of the  assessed costs. In this case, that would include s. 5 of the  Disbursements  and Expert Evidence Regulation .  [12]     I note that the timing of the filing of the notice of trial, the trial  date that was set and the date the disbursements were incurred will all be  issues for the Registrar to consider in their assessment of the bill of costs  pursuant to s. 5(3)(b) of the  Disbursements and Expert Evidence  Regulation .  [13]     Accordingly, I order the following.  a)   judgment in the  terms of the defendants' offer to settle dated October 6, 2021, accepted by the  plaintiff on October 8, 2021, both of which letters are to be attached as  Appendix A to this Order;  b)   the defendants  pay to the plaintiff the costs of the action to October 6, 2021, assessed in  accordance with Rule 14-1 of the  Supreme Court Civil Rules ; and c)   the costs and  disbursements of the plaintiff be assessed by the Registrar with application of  s. 5 of the  Disbursements and Expert Evidence Regulation . [14]     With respect to the costs of this application, although the plaintiff  has not been successful in this application, this was a matter which had to be  clarified for both parties before the assessment of the bill of costs could  properly occur, and accordingly I make no order as to costs. [15]     Is there anything arising counsel? [16]     COUNSEL: No, thank you, Justice. [17]     COUNSEL: Thank you. [18]     THE COURT: Thank you very much. [19]     I gave these reasons orally at the conclusion of the submissions. I have  edited them without change to the substance or result.  \u201cBlake  J.\u201d",

Respondent (Respondent) Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice Groberman The Honourable Mr. Justice Hunter The Honourable Madam Justice Griffin On an application to  vary: An order of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, dated September 18,  2019 ( K.F.M. v. K.G.T. , 2019 BCCA 339,   Vancouver Docket CA46217).  Oral Reasons for Judgment The Appellant, appearing in person: K.F.M. Counsel for the Respondent: M.G. Perry Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 6, 2020 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 6, 2020   Summary: The appellant seeks a review  of a decision denying him leave to appeal an interim order under the Family Law  Act conferring sole authority on the respondent to make health-related  decisions concerning their son pending trial. Held: Application dismissed. The  leave judge did not commit an error of law or principle and did not  misapprehend the evidence. [1]     HUNTER J.A. : On July 5, 2019, an order was made in the Supreme  Court of British Columbia that granted the respondent, K.G.T., the sole  authority on an interim basis to make decisions related to the health of the  parties\u2019 eight-year-old child. The order was made in the context of high  conflict family litigation between the parties, who separated in October 2011  and have been engaged in disputes over the parental responsibilities for their  child for much of the intervening eight years. The trial of this longstanding  litigation is now scheduled for July of 2020. [2]     Although the transcript of the chambers judge\u2019s reasons refers to  s. 45(f) of the  Family Law Act , S.B.C. 2011, c. 25, it is  apparent that the order was made by reference to s. 41(f) of that  Act . [3]     The child resides with his mother, K.G.T. His father, K.F.M., has  parenting time of eight hours per week in accordance with interim orders made  and varied throughout the eight years of litigation. For clarity in these  reasons, I will refer to the applicant K.F.M. as the Father, and the respondent  K.G.T. as the Mother. [4]     The basis of the July 5 order was a concern that the parties\u2019 child  required psychological counselling but the Father was refusing to consent to  the referral to a child psychiatrist recommended by the child\u2019s general  practitioner. A physician had been retained to prepare a s. 211 Child  Custody, Parenting Capacity and Parenting Time report, but it was not anticipated  that the report would be completed until a few months before trial. The Supreme  Court chambers judge who heard the Mother\u2019s application considered the Father\u2019s  reasons for not consenting to counselling and other mental health  recommendations to have no merit. The effect of the order was that pending  trial, the Mother would make all decisions concerning the child\u2019s physical and  health treatments. [5]     The Father wishes to appeal this July 5 order. Because the July 5 order  grants interim relief under the  Family Law Act , leave to appeal is  required. The Father sought leave to appeal before a judge of this Court in  chambers, but his application was dismissed for reasons indexed at 2019 BCCA  339. He seeks a review of that decision by a division of this Court pursuant to  s. 9(6) of the  Court of Appeal Act , R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 77. [6]     At the outset, it is important to note that a review of a  decision of a chambers judge is not a re-hearing of the application. The  standard to be applied by a division of this Court on a review application was  summarized by Madam Justice Dickson in  Lungu v. British Columbia (Human  Rights Tribunal) ,  2016  BCCA 136 ,  in these terms: [8] A review  application brought before a division of the court under s. 9(6) of the  Act   does not provide an opportunity for a rehearing of the original chambers  application. The standard of review is whether the justice sitting in chambers  was wrong in law, wrong in principle, or misconceived the facts. In the absence  of such an error, the court will not interfere with the chambers judge\u2019s  exercise of discretion:  DeFehr v. DeFehr,   2002  BCCA 139  at para.  6 . [7]     Thus, the question for this Court is whether in exercising his  discretion not to grant leave to appeal, the chambers judge was wrong in law,  wrong in principle, or misconceived the facts. [8]     With this standard in mind, I turn to the decision of the chambers  judge, who for clarity I will refer to as the leave judge. The leave judge  began by reviewing the circumstances in which the order had been made. A series  of applications was before the Supreme Court chambers judge on July 5. The  Father had sought an order varying the interim parenting time order to increase  his parenting time and to entitle him to travel with the child in the summer. The  chambers judge was not prepared to change the parenting time order. That part  of the July 5 order is not in issue in this Court. [9]     In addition, the Mother sought a series of orders relating to the  allocation of parental responsibilities. The Father objected to those  applications being heard on July 5 due to insufficient notice, and the chambers  judge gave effect to this objection in respect of all of the Mother\u2019s  applications except the application concerning the child\u2019s health-related  treatments. The chambers judge explained his reasoning for proceeding with that  application in these terms: [6] Having read and  considered the materials before me, in the circumstances I am satisfied that  there is some urgency to the respondent\u2019s application, but only as it relates  to the child\u2019s health-related treatment and, accordingly, I am allowing the  respondent to bring her application in that regard by way of short notice. The  balance of the respondent\u2019s application will have to be heard on a later date  convenient to the parties and Madam Justice Fleming, who is the case management  judge assigned to this matter and who is familiar with these proceedings. [10]     The leave judge then reviewed the chambers judge\u2019s assessment of the  evidence. He summarized the chambers judge\u2019s assessment in this way: [11] The chambers judge expressed serious concern about  the child\u2019s mental health. He understood that [the Father] was convinced that  the situation is one involving parental alienation by [the Mother]. Given that Dr. England  had been retained to assess the entire situation and prepare a full s. 211  parenting assessment, the judge considered that no change in parenting time  should be ordered until that assessment had been completed. Accordingly, he  dismissed [the Father\u2019s] application. [12] The chambers judge  found no merit in [the Father\u2019s] reasons for not consenting to counselling and  other recommended mental health modalities. Given this, and the judge\u2019s  concerns about the child\u2019s mental health, he granted the order sought by [the  Mother]. [11]     The leave judge then turned to the law relating to leave to appeal, and  cited the test in this way: [ 13 ] The party seeking  leave to appeal bears the burden of showing that leave should be granted:  British  Columbia Teachers\u2019 Federation v. British Columbia (Attorney General)   (1986),  4 B.C.L.R. (2d) 8  at 11 (C.A.) (in Chambers) . The criteria to be  applied are well-established: (1) whether the  point on appeal is of significance to the practice; (2) whether the  point raised is of significance to the action itself; (3) whether the  appeal is  prima facie  meritorious or, on the  other hand, whether it is frivolous; and (4) whether the  appeal will unduly hinder the progress of the action. See also  Goldman,  Sachs & Co. v. Sessions,   2000  BCCA 326  at para.  10  (Saunders J.A. in Chambers) . The overarching concern is the interests of justice and the four  criteria are \u201call considered under the rubric of the interests of justice\u201d:  Movassaghi  v. Aghtai,   2010  BCCA 175  at para.  22  (D. Smith J.A. in Chambers)  and the cases cited therein. [12]     This test is well accepted in this Court, and I can see no error in the  leave judge\u2019s statement of the applicable law. [13]     The leave judge went on to point out the high hurdle faced by appellants  who seek appeals of interim orders in family matters: [ 16 ] The  court\u2019s jurisdiction to vary interim orders made in family matters is  \u201cextremely limited\u201d, and it will only interfere with such orders \u201cin  exceptional circumstances\u201d:  N. (T.) v. N. (J.C.),   2013 BCCA 432  at para.  10  (Levine J.A. in Chambers);  F. (J.G.) v. B. (C.L.),   2003 BCCA 382  at para.  10  (Huddart J.A. in Chambers). [14]     This principle is also well accepted in this Court. [15]     The leave judge then considered the grounds for appeal, which comprise  35 numbered paragraphs in the amended notice of application for leave to  appeal, but which the leave judge summarized in this way (para. 20): a) whether the chambers judge erred in  allowing [the Mother\u2019s] application to proceed on short leave, despite her  non-compliance with the service requirements in the  Supreme Court  Family Rules  and despite the informal protocol  established by the case management judge; and b) whether  the chambers judge misapprehended the evidence and erred in his assessment of  urgency. [16]     The leave judge reviewed the submissions of the Father and concluded  that he had not identified a good arguable case of sufficient merit to warrant  scrutiny by a division of this Court. The Father submits that the judgment  refusing leave contains factual inaccuracies and does not give effect to what  he characterizes as the breach of his procedural rights in hearing the Mother\u2019s  application on short notice. The alleged breach of procedural rights concerns  the decision of the chambers judge to hear and decide the application  concerning the child\u2019s health needs, without the Mother having given proper  notice under the Rules. The leave judge considered that the procedural issue  was not one that satisfied the requirement of a point of significance to the  practice or the parties. I would go further. In my view, there is no reasonable  prospect that a division of this Court would interfere with the exercise of a  chambers judge\u2019s discretion to hear this application on short notice given the  material that was before the judge. [17]     The applicant has put a number of authorities before us in support of  his review application, but I consider it necessary to address only one,  Williamson  v. Williamson , 2016 BCCA 87.  Williamson  was one of those rare cases  where this Court did interfere with an interim order relating to family  litigation, but the circumstances were very different. The mother in that case  had sought an order for inpatient counselling for the children of the marriage,  but the application had been dismissed by a judge of the Supreme Court. The  mother then brought an identical application before a different judge, who  granted the order, apparently on the mistaken belief that the first judge had  not made a decision on the first application. This Court held that the second  judge had erred in hearing the mother\u2019s application without first finding there  was a material change in circumstances from those prevailing at the time the first  application was dismissed.  Williamson  did not involve an emergent  situation of mental health needs of the child requiring an interim order to  break an impasse between the parents. [18]     In the case at bar, the chambers judge was of the view that there was  urgency in addressing the child\u2019s mental health needs. Although the Father  disputes that assessment, there was ample evidence before the chambers judge to  justify this conclusion. There is no reasonable possibility that a division of  this Court would interfere with that determination. [19]     In my view, the refusal of leave to appeal was an appropriate exercise  of the leave judge\u2019s discretion, and I can see no error that would justify  interfering with the order. Accordingly, I would dismiss the application to discharge  or vary the order refusing leave to appeal. [20]     The leave judge also dismissed a second application brought by the  Father for an order that he be permitted to file materials without paying court  fees, generally referred to as a no fees order, as he did not consider that the  position being argued by the Father had merit, which is a prerequisite to a no  fees order. For the reasons I have outlined in relation to the leave  application, I can see no error in that decision. [21]     As a result, I would dismiss the application to discharge or vary the  order refusing leave to appeal and refusing a no fees order. Costs of this  application are payable to the respondent. [22]     GROBERMAN J.A. : I agree. [23]     GRIFFIN J.A. : I agree. [24]     GROBERMAN J.A. : The application to discharge or vary the order is  dismissed. \u201cThe  Honourable Mr. Justice Hunter\u201d",

Jiwani,   2022 BCSC 95 Date: 20220107 Docket: E150451 Registry:  Vancouver Between: Pareen Jiwani Claimant And Nawaz Jiwani, also  known as Nick Jiwani Baseline  Development Ltd. Respondent Before:  The Honourable Justice Fleming Oral Reasons for Judgment   (In  Chambers) Counsel for the Claimant  appearing via teleconference: P.J. Reimer Counsel for the Respondents appearing via teleconference: J.R. Bienvenu R.A. Hira, Articled   Student Place and Date of Trial/Hearing: Vancouver, B.C. January 7, 2022 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, B.C. January 7, 2022   [1]     THE COURT:  I wish to make the parties aware that if a transcript  of these reasons is ordered, I will edit them to perhaps clarify my meaning and  add case citations etc.  [2]     The respondent, Nawaz Jiwani, applies for an order disqualifying the  claimant, Pareen Jiwani's counsel, Paul Reimer from continuing to represent her  in this family law proceeding. Mr. Reimer also acts for Ms. Jiwani in  a related civil proceeding brought against Mr. Jiwani and several others,  which Mr. Reimer submits ought to be tried together with this one given the  overlapping and interrelated factual issues. [3]     The basis for the application is Mr. Jiwani's assertion that  Mr. Reimer will be a necessary witness at the trial in this proceeding because  of Ms. Jiwani's claim related to a marriage agreement, which the parties  negotiated and signed in July 2015, during a reconciliation after a prior  separation. During the initial separation, Ms. Jiwani filed, but never  served, the notice of family claim, which Mr. Reimer certified. He also  provided her with legal advice regarding the marriage agreement. The parties  separated for the last time in December 2015. [4]     In the amended notice of family claim, Ms. Jiwani seeks an order  pursuant to s. 93(3) of the  Family Law Act , S.B.C. 2011, c. 25, setting  aside the marriage agreement, pleading the following: a)   the respondent  having failed to disclose significant property or other information relevant to  the negotiation of the agreement;  b)   the respondent  having taken improper advantage of the claimant's vulnerability, including her  ignorance, need or distress; and  c)   such other  circumstances which would, under the common law, cause all or part of that  contract to be voidable. [5]     The marriage agreement itself attaches various lists of assets and  liabilities as schedules. Mr. Jiwani's list and those for the corporations  in which he is the sole or controlling shareholder are attached as Schedule B,  D, and E respectively.  [6]     Ms. Jiwani alleges that during the course of this proceeding she  has learned that Mr. Jiwani has divested himself of approximately $2.847  million in funds that are subject to division as family property since their  initial separation. She also alleges he holds undisclosed accounts, has failed  to make proper CRA payments, his corporate entities have significant  outstanding CRA debts, and he has engaged in a number of other financial  transactions using family property, all of which are summarized at paras. 7, 9\u201311,  and 16\u201324 of the application response. The remaining assets, which he agrees  are family property and available to divide, says Ms. Jiwani, are funds in the  amount of approximately $1 million held in trust, which consist of the  remaining net proceeds from the sale of the family home. [7]     It has now been six years since the parties' final separation. Ms. Jiwani  has not been examined for discovery. Examinations for discovery of  Mr. Jiwani were conducted in 2017 and 2019. He has not disputed her assertion  that he has yet to produce any of the various documents and information  requested during those discoveries. [8]     Mr. Jiwani takes the position that Mr. Reimer is a necessary  witness, and as a witness, would have a conflict of interest that would  disqualify him from continuing to represent Ms. Jiwani. Mr. Jiwani  argues that by advising Ms. Jiwani to sign the marriage agreement and  observing her state of mind at the time, along perhaps with other dealings with  her, Mr. Reimer's evidence will be crucial. In making the argument,  Mr. Jiwani focuses on Ms. Jiwani's pleadings with respect to the  marriage agreement that he took improper advantage of her vulnerability, including  her ignorance, need or distress. Without addressing her affidavit evidence,  Mr. Jiwani submits the moment Ms. Jiwani says she was coerced or  under duress, which he anticipates she will, Mr. Reimer will be called as  a witness. He also suggests Mr. Reimer's evidence regarding her alleged  vulnerability is also necessary. [9]     Mr. Jiwani further argues the timing of this application, prior to the  setting of a trial date, minimizes the prejudice to her because it will allow  her time to retain and instruct new counsel.  [10]     Mr. Reimer submits that, and it is clear, Ms. Jiwani's  pleadings simply track the language of s. 93(3)(a), (b) and (d) of the  Family  Law Act . He points out that she does not rely on s. 93(3)(c), which  reads \u201cthe spouse did not understand the nature or consequence of the  agreement\u201d and emphasizes that her state of mind is not at issue. She does not  plead undue influence, coercion, or duress, and she does not allege actual need  or distress. Mr. Reimer also suggests that leave be granted to allow her to  amend the pleadings to remove that language if the court is of the view her  pleadings require clarification. The only vulnerability she asserts is based on  ignorance arising from a lack of knowledge of the parties' assets and debts,  which she attributes to Mr. Jiwani's alleged fraud and deceit. [11]     Mr. Reimer's submissions are consistent with Ms. Jiwani's  affidavit evidence regarding the basis for her claim to set aside the marriage  agreement, the effort involved in trying to uncover the state of the parties'  assets and debts prior to the marriage agreement, and Mr. Jiwani's  financial conduct since then. [12]     There is no disagreement about the applicable legal principles which are  set out in the notice of application and application response. In summary, the  court has an inherent jurisdiction to remove a lawyer from the record who has a  conflict of interest, including a lawyer who may be a witness in a case where  they act as counsel (see  Ontario Realty Corp. v. Gabriele & Sons Limited ,  [2006] O.J. No. 4497 (Ont. S.C.J.) at para. 16 and  MacDonald Estate v.  Martin , [1990] 3 S.C.R. 1235 at para. 18). The concern that arises  when a lawyer testifies is there may be a conflict of interest between the  client and the lawyer, and the administration of justice can be impaired by a  conflict in the lawyer's obligation of objectivity to the court, and their  obligation as an advocate to the client. The factors the court considers  include: (a) maintaining the high standard of the legal profession and the  integrity of the justice system; and (b) the right of a litigant to counsel of  choice, which they should not be deprived of without good cause ( Ontario  Realty  at para. 17, citing  MacDonald Estate  at para. 12) The test to  be applied is whether a fair\u2011minded reasonably informed member of the  public would conclude that a proper administration of justice requires the  removal of the lawyer ( Ontario Realty  at para. 20;  Karas et al. v. Her  Majesty the Queen et al. , 2011 ONSC 5181 at para. 26). The cases have  recognized that when a litigant is deprived of a lawyer of their choice, a  hardship may arise, which can only be justified to prevent a more serious  injustice (see for example  Urquhart v. Allen Estate , [1999] O.J. No.  4816 (Ont. S.C.J.). While certainty that a lawyer will be called as a witness is  not required, the applicant must establish it is likely that counsel can  provide material evidence:  Ontario Realty  at paras. 34-35. In  Gichuru  v. Purewal , 2017 BCCA 281 at para. 17, the Court of Appeal characterized a  removal order as an extraordinary remedy, to be approached with great caution  and rarely invoked. [13]     I have no difficulty in concluding that a fair\u2011minded reasonably  informed member of the public would not conclude that the proper administration  of justice requires the removal of Mr. Reimer. On the contrary, I am quite  confident that a person so situated would share my view that the spectre of  injustice would only be raised by granting such an order. I have a significant  concern that this application is a strategic one. In my view it should never  have been brought. Based on the materials before me, it is quite obvious that  Ms. Jiwani's state of mind, as opposed to her state of knowledge at the  time of the marriage agreement, is not the issue. The primary, if not sole,  issue as it relates to her claim to set aside the marriage agreement is what  she understood the parties' assets and liabilities to be, and what they in fact  were and are. The evidence relevant to this issue lies not with Mr. Reimer.  Depriving Ms. Jiwani of her right to counsel of choice would cause an  undoubted hardship. Mr. Reimer has acted for her for many years in this  proceeding, which involves difficult and complex financial issues, and a very  significant and serious family debt and property claim based on allegations of  fraudulent misrepresentation and diversion of assets that have a much greater  value than the known assets. [14]     I therefore dismiss the application. [15]     Given my significant concern about the unreasonableness of the  application, I order the respondent to not only pay the claimant's costs of the  application, but to pay them forthwith. [16]     CNSL P. REIMER: It's Paul Reimer speaking. Thank you, Madam Justice,  fixing costs? [17]     THE COURT: Yes, do you have an amount to suggest? [18]     CNSL P. REIMER: Well, this has been our second day at this, I suppose  $1,500. [19]     THE COURT: Mr. Bienvenu, do you have any submissions about the  amount? [20]     CNSL J. BIENVENU: No, Madam Justice, this is \u2011\u2011 I  mean, we sat around for a day, this is why it's the second day, my submission  would be a thousand dollars. [21]     THE COURT: Well, if it has taken up two days of counsel's time, I will  fix the amount at $1,500. [22]     CNSL P. REIMER: Thank you, Madam Justice. \u201cFleming  J.\u201d",

        "text": "COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA Citation: Henderson v. Mawji,   2020 BCCA 43 Date: 20200113 Dockets:  CA46535; CA46536 Docket: CA46535 Between: Nicole Christine  Henderson Appellant (Plaintiff) And Gulzar Mawji Respondent (Defendant) - and - Docket: CA46536 Between: Nicole Christine  Csurdi Appellant (Plaintiff) And Katelyn Bannon Respondent (Defendant) Before: The Honourable Madam Justice Garson (In Chambers) On appeal from: An order  of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, dated October 31, 2019 ( Csurdi  v. Bannon , 2019 BCSC 2280, New Westminster   Dockets M193837 and M172624). Oral Reasons for Judgment   Counsel for the Appellant: T.P. Harding Counsel for the Respondents: D.J. Sinnott Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 8, 2020 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 13, 2020   Summary: The appellant applies to  extend time to serve notices of appeal in two related actions. Held:  Applications dismissed. The appellant concedes that the only point of the  appeal is to argue that an evidentiary ruling from the trial below should not  bind a new trial. However, previous evidentiary rulings do not bind new trials.  As a result, the proposed appeal lacks merit.  [1]     GARSON J.A. : These are applications before a single justice in  chambers to extend time to serve notices of appeal in two related actions. The  notices of appeal were served four days late. [2]     The appellant in both actions is the same person. She now uses the name  Nicole Christine Henderson. [3]     The criteria that govern this application to extend time pursuant to  s. 10(2)(d) of the  Court of Appeal Act,  R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 77, are  set out in  Davies v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce  (1987),  15 B.C.L.R. (2d) 256  at 259\u2013260 (C.A.) : 1.     Was there a  bona fide  intention to appeal? 2.     When were the respondents informed of the intention? 3.     Would the respondents be unduly prejudiced by an extension of time? 4.     Is there merit in the appeal? 5.   Is it in  the interest of justice that an extension be granted? [4]     The merits threshold asks whether the appeal is \u201cdoomed to fail,\u201d or,  alternatively, whether \u201cit can be said with confidence that the appeal has no  merit\u201d:  Stewart v. Postnikoff , 2014 BCCA 292  at  paras. 5\u2013 6  (Chambers) . [5]     The final factor \u201cencompasses the other four questions and states the  decisive question\u201d:  Davies  at 260. As a  result, the merit of an appeal is also considered at that stage. In  A  Solicitor v. The Law Society of British Columbia , 2018 BCCA 163 at para. 37,  Bennett J.A. held that it \u201cis not in the interests of justice to permit a meritless  appeal to go forward.\u201d [6]     It is only the fourth and fifth criteria that are of concern in this  application. [7]     The underlying appeal is from an order in two personal injury actions.  The trial judge pronounced a mistrial. As a result of the mistrial, the jury  was discharged, and the judge ordered a new trial. The question that arises on  these facts is whether there is any utility to the appeals. [8]     The appellant contends that in the trial the judge ruled that certain  evidence concerning the plaintiff\u2019s history of childhood abuse was irrelevant,  prejudicial, and therefore inadmissible. The appellant says the point of the  appeal is to argue that the judge erred in his ruling and, importantly, that  the ruling should not bind or carry forward to the new trial. [9]     Apart from the appellant\u2019s concern about the implications of the  evidentiary ruling on the new trial, the appellant concedes there is no point  to the appeal. [10]     The other criteria in  Davies , as to the appellant\u2019s intention to  appeal, notice to the respondents, and lack of prejudice to the respondents,  are all satisfied. As I said, the extension is only for four days. Counsel for  the applicant concedes that on appeal his only claim for relief is a new trial,  and that Justice Mayer has already ordered a new trial. But he says underlying  that order for a new trial is an erroneous evidentiary ruling. He is concerned  that the judge hearing the new trial will be bound by the evidentiary rulings  made at the trial that ended in a mistrial. The respondents say there is no  utility to this appeal and the extension ought not to be granted. Because an appeal  is from an order and not reasons, I conclude, and agree with the respondents, there  is no utility and, hence no merit, to the appeal.  [11]     The appeal is also ill\u2011conceived because the underlying  evidentiary rulings do not bind the new trial judge. [12]     In  Coulter v. Ball , 2007 BCSC 720,   Goepel J. (as he then was)  explained the law as it pertains to a new trial following a  successful  appeal : [ 19 ] Where a new trial is ordered, the  judge presiding at the new trial is not bound by findings made at the first  trial. A new trial is wholly independent of the first:  Bobolas &  another v. Economist Newspaper Ltd. , [1987] 3 All E.R. 121 (C.A.). [ 20 ] At a  new trial, all questions of fact in regards to the issues retried are at large  and are to be considered afresh:  Lewis v. Cook and Akenhead ,  [1950] 4 D.L.R. 136 (B.C.C.A.). The issues are considered  tabula rasa . The  parties may raise any issue pled regardless of the position taken at the first  trial:  Confederation Life Insurance Co. v. Woo  (1994), 123 Sask.  R. 150 (C.A.). [13]      Lewis v. Cook and Akenhead , [1950] 4 D.L.R. 136 (B.C.C.A.), mentioned  by Goepel J. in  Coulter  and followed in  Confederation Life Insurance  Co. v. Woo  (1994), 48 A.C.W.S. (3d) 1019 (Sask. C.A.), provides the  following guidance on the effect of a new trial:  [11] We are all of the opinion that the only order we  can make is that there should be a new trial. We are of the opinion that the learned  Judge who may take the second trial is, and should be, absolutely untrammelled  by any decision of the learned Judge who took the first trial, and on that I  wish to refer to two cases. The first case is  Roe v. Naylor  (1918), 87  L.J.K.B. 958, 119 LT 259. The Master of the Rolls said at p. 963:  Counsel for the appellants sought to rely upon some finding  of the Judge in the first trial of the action. In my opinion, he is not  entitled to do that. This action was sent for a new trial, and the second trial  superseded the first, and any finding in the first action was got rid of when  the action was sent for a new trial. [12] Now that refers apparently to a finding of fact.  The next case I am about to state refers to a question of law \u2014  Venn v.  Tedesco , [1926] 2 K.B. 227, 95 L.J.K.B. 866. McCardie J. said at p. 237:   Such is the view I must take of the main point of law argued  before me, but I ought, ere concluding this judgment, to refer briefly to  another point raised on the plaintiff's behalf\u2014namely, that, inasmuch as the  defendants' counsel, at the first trial of this action before the Lord Chief  Justice and a special jury, stated that he did not seek to rely on the  Public  Authorities Protection Act, 1893 , he was therefore precluded from raising  the point before me on the second trial of the action. I am unable to agree  with that contention. The point was one of law only. It involved no evidence,  and the facts on the point were not only admitted, but were actually pleaded in  the statement of claim itself. There is, I think, no estoppel in the matter.  The trial before me was a  de novo  hearing, and the defendants were  entitled to raise before me the point pleaded in their statement of defence. My  recollection is that this question has been decided by the Court of Appeal as I  now decide it, though I am unable to find a reported decision on the matter.  The cases quoted in the  Annual Practice , 1926 ed., p. 1154, tend, I  think, to support the view I now express. [14]     I agree with Goepel J. in  Coulter  and can see no reason why these  same principles would not apply equally in respect of an evidentiary ruling at a  new trial following a mistrial (as opposed to an appeal).  [15]     Similarly, although not binding, in a criminal context guidance may be  found in  R. v. Hilson , [1958] O.R. 665 (C.A.). The court allowed an  appeal from a murder conviction on the basis of errors in the jury charge and  remitted the matter for a new trial. In so doing, it noted that it found no  error in the trial judge\u2019s decision to admit a confession. Nevertheless, it  cautioned that this ruling was not binding on the retrial: at paras. 3\u20134. [16]     That principle was endorsed in  R. v. Duhamel , 1981 ABCA 295 at para. 23,  aff\u2019d, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 555. In  R. c. Cliche , 2010 QCCA 408,  Beauregard J.A. considered whether  Hilson  and  Duhamel  applied in  respect of a retrial following a mistrial, as opposed to an appeal. He found no  principled reason for distinguishing between the two situations, at paras. 13\u201317. [17]     Edwards J. also appears to have reached the same conclusion in  H.M.T.Q.  v. Dempsey , 2001 BCSC 371 at para. 7, where he applied  Hilson  in  relation to a retrial following a mistrial. [18]     Parenthetically, I recognize that in relation to criminal matters,   Cliche  and  Dempsey  have been overtaken by legislative developments.  In 2011, the  Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C\u201146   was  amended to include s. 653.1: Mistrial \u2014 rulings binding at new trial 653.1  In  the case of a mistrial, unless the court is satisfied that it would not be in  the interests of justice, rulings relating to the disclosure or admissibility  of evidence or the  Canadian  Charter of Rights and Freedoms  that were made during the trial  are binding on the parties in any new trial if the rulings are made \u2014 or could  have been made \u2014 before the stage at which the evidence on the merits is  presented. [19]     Parties to a retrial are entitled to reframe their case. They may choose  to adduce different evidence and advance different legal arguments, subject  only to the limitations imposed by their pleadings and the doctrine of abuse of  process. In those circumstances, the analysis of relevance, materiality, and  probative value of a given piece of evidence may be fundamentally different  than in the previous trial. The reasoning in the criminal authorities to which  I have referred, while not directly applicable, is persuasive. [20]     It follows that I would, in these circumstances, dismiss the applications  for the extension of time on the grounds that there is no merit or utility in  the appeals and, consequently, it is not in the interests of justice that  either of these applications for extensions of time be granted. [21]     The applications in both appeals to extend time to serve notices of  appeal are dismissed. Both appeals stand dismissed. \u201cThe Honourable Madam Justice Garson\u201d",

        "text": "IN THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA Citation: Hanlon (Re),   2021 BCSC 40 Date: 20210112 Docket: B190492 Registry:  Vancouver   Estate No. 11-2523540 In  Bankruptcy and Insolvency In  the Matter of the Bankruptcy of Lee Hanlon Before:  The Honourable Madam Justice Forth Reasons for Judgment Counsel for the Applicant, Jolene Karen Johnson, via teleconference: C.G. Reedman   Linda Paul, Licensed Insolvency Trustee, appearing on  her own behalf, via teleconference: L. Paul   Appearing on his own behalf, via teleconference: L. Hanlon   Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, B.C. November 26, 2020 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, B.C. January 12, 2021   [1]     Jolene Karen Johnson is a creditor in the Estate of the Bankrupt Lee  Hanlon and applies for an order pursuant to s. 163(2) of the  Bankruptcy and  Insolvency Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 (the \u201c BIA \u201d) that Mr. Hanlon and  Gwen Woods, his mother, be examined under oath and any discharge hearing be  held after these examinations have been completed. In addition, Ms. Johnson  seeks an order pursuant to the same section that documents be produced. [2]     The notice of application filed September 4, 2020, also sought an order  to allow Ms. Johnson to commence and prosecute a proceeding against Mr.  Hanlon\u2019s former employer. This aspect of the application was adjourned  generally.  [3]     Ms. Johnson obtained a judgment against Mr. Hanlon after a five day  defamation trial that took place in August 2018. On April 23, 2019, Justice  Dardi issued her reasons, indexed at 2019 BCSC 622. Ms. Johnson is referred to  as Dianna Holden in those reasons. She changed her name from Dianna Holden to  Jolene Johnson after starting that litigation. Ms. Johnson was awarded damages  in the amount of $27,500 against Mr. Hanlon. A co-defendant was made jointly  liable for $1,000. Ms. Johnson was also granted a permanent injunction against  the defendants prohibiting them from publishing defamatory statements  respecting her. On August 30, 2019, she was awarded special costs which have  not yet been assessed.  [4]     On June 14, 2019, Mr. Hanlon filed a proposal under s. 62 of the  BIA.   [5]     At a meeting of creditors held on July 30, 2019, Cody G. Reedman,  Ms. Johnson\u2019s counsel, was appointed as inspector of the estate. At this meeting,  Mr. Hanlon advised, which is recorded in the Minutes, that \u201cthere was an  expectation that any amounts owing to his mother would be deducted from his  inheritance.\u201d  [6]     On August 13, 2019, Ms. Johnson filed a Notice of Intended Opposition to  Mr. Hanlon\u2019s discharge.  [7]     On February 3, 2020, Ms. Johnson filed an amended proof of claim. In it  she made an unsecured claim for $94,443.01, consisting of the original judgment  amount, post-judgment interest, and a claim of $66,788.26 for special costs.  [8]     On February 26, 2020 Mr. Hanlon was examined under oath by Brian Chau,  Official Receiver.  [9]     Ms. Johnson has made a number of requests for information and documents  which she claims have not been answered.  [10]     Ms. Johnson argues that Mr. Hanlon should be subjected to an examination  so that she can canvass issues relating to: \u00b7     If he is a beneficiary under his mother\u2019s will and the potential  of an inheritance being received; \u00b7     Information respecting Mr. Hanlon\u2019s bank accounts and credit  cards, including his use of his mother\u2019s credit card; \u00b7     Monies and loans Mr. Hanlon may have received from his parents; \u00b7     How Mr. Hanlon is paying for expenses; and \u00b7     Particulars relating to the companies Mr. Hanlon operates, the  income he earns, and whether he has been intentionally underemployed. [11]     She argues that an examination of Mr. Hanlon is necessary since the  evidence produced to date supports that \u201csomething is amiss\u201d and there is \u201ca disconnect\u201d  respecting Mr. Hanlon\u2019s financial circumstances.  [12]     Ms. Johnson seeks to examine Ms. Woods respecting the financial  circumstances between her and Mr. Hanlon and any arrangements concerning the  will, inheritance, and financial documentation. She argues that Ms. Woods is  directly connected to the bankrupt estate. [13]     Ms. Johnson seeks the production of documents from Mr. Hanlon and  Ms. Woods consisting of all books, documents, correspondence or papers  relating in all or in part to the Bankrupt or the estate of the Bankrupt,  including the wrongful dismissal action, details of any inheritance from Ms.  Woods to the Bankrupt, and financial records concerning the Bankrupt\u2019s use of  Ms. Woods\u2019 bank accounts and credit cards.  [14]     Mr. Hanlon submits that his mother and stepfather are still alive. If  his mother dies everything will go to her husband. They have been married for  40 years and the house is in joint tenancy. He advised that his mother is  currently 85 years old, she has mobility issues, and is deaf in both ears. His  stepfather is either 72 or 73 years old. He opposes the examination of his  mother as being in the nature of a fishing expedition. [15]     He disputes that there is anything amiss in respect to the documents  provided. He explains the reason there is a senior\u2019s discount reference on the  bank accounts is because it is a joint account with his stepfather who is a  senior. He explained that the only time he has used his mother\u2019s credit card  was to pay a process server who required a credit card over the phone. He  denies ever accessing his mother\u2019s bank account. [16]     He submits that he has provided an explanation of his work history,  including what companies he worked for. He submits that the applications be  dismissed as they are without merit, a fishing expedition, and made in order to  delay the discharge hearing.  [17]     Ms. Paul advised that she was taking no position in the application but  did make the following submissions. [18]     She advised the Court that an examination of Mr. Hanlon under oath had taken  place. Mr. Hanlon has been extremely forthcoming with everything that he has  been asked. To her knowledge there are no outstanding requests. It would be an  unusual request to demand the production of a will from someone who is still  living. If Mr. Hanlon\u2019s mother passes away then Ms. Paul will take all  necessary steps to investigate. Finally, she is of the view that the  application to discharge should proceed. The discharge hearing has been  delayed. [19]     Section 163(2) of the  BIA  provides: (2) On the  application to the court by the Superintendent, any creditor or other  interested person and on sufficient cause being shown, an order may be made for  the examination under oath, before the registrar or other authorized person, of  the trustee, the bankrupt, an inspector or a creditor, or any other person  named in the order, for the purpose of investigating the administration of the  estate of any bankrupt, and the court may further order any person liable to be  so examined to produce any books, documents, correspondence or papers in the  person\u2019s possession or power relating in all or in part to the bankrupt, the  trustee or any creditor, the costs of the examination and investigation to be  in the discretion of the court. [20]     Justice Voith, as he then was, in  Branconnier (Re) , 2017 BCSC  1896, sets out a list of the applicable principles at para. 70: i)   the  onus is on an applicant to demonstrate that there is sufficient cause to  justify the examination being sought:  Ellis (Re ), 2013 SKQB 225 at para.  4; ii)   the  examination must be for the general benefit of creditors and it must relate to  the general administration of the bankrupt\u2019s estate:  Assaf (Re)  (1976),  23 C.B.R. (N.S.) 14 (Ont. SCJ) at para. 6; iii)   as  a necessary corollary to the foregoing principle a creditor cannot seek to  conduct an examination for a collateral purpose or for reasons connected with  other litigation:  Assaf  at para. 5 and  Thomson Kernaghan & Co.  (Re)  [2003] O.J. No. 5300 at para. 9; iv)   the  person to be examined is someone who has a factual connection to the bankrupt\u2019s  estate or to estate issues and is someone who may shed light on those issues:  Ellis   at para. 6;  v)   the  bar for showing or establishing \u201csufficient cause\u201d is low:  Ellis  at  para. 7,  Kane (Re) , 2011 NBQB 142 at para. 26 and  Josipovicz (Re) ,  2012 ONSC 5361 at para. 14; In  Black v. Ernst & Young Inc.  (1997), 47 C.B.R.  (3d) 129 the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal stated that orders for examination  under s. 163(2) \u201cusually issue as a matter of course\u201d: at para. 20.  Respectfully, this may set the required standard too low. It is clear that the  applicant must provide some evidence in support of its application and that the  court must be satisfied that the application is neither frivolous or oppressive  or in the nature of a fishing expedition:  NsC Diesel Power Inc. (Re)  [1998]  N.S.J. No. 303 (N.S.C.A.) at para. 17 and  Ellis  at para. 6. In  Josipovicz  the court said that a creditor is  required to file evidence that demonstrates that the person sought to be  examined likely possesses information \u201cwhich may shed some light on the estate  or its administration\u201d: at para. 17. Some cases have suggested that the evidence adduced must  establish or show \u201csomething being amiss\u201d and that the named party has the  ability to shed light on that matter. In  Josipovicz , however, Brown J.  said: [ 15 ]   Although some of the cases have suggested that an order should not be granted  under section 163(2) unless the creditor demonstrated that something was  \u201camiss\u201d, that word risks deflecting the focus of the judicial inquiry on such a  motion. Certainly, if something is \u201camiss\u201d, further investigation may be  merited. But, equally, an investigation may be appropriate where an  examination is required to reconcile, or shed further light on, conflicting  information gathered by the trustee. In such a case nothing may be  \u201camiss\u201d, but an inquiry is needed. So, where an order is sought under  section 163(2) against a third party \u2013 i.e. neither the bankrupt nor the  trustee \u2013 the focus should be on whether the examination likely will secure  information required by the trustee to continue with or complete the  administration of the estate of the bankrupt. vi)   The  scope of the eventual examination is \u201cquite wide but not infinite\u201d:  McDonough  (Re) , 27 C.B.R. (4th) 279 at para. 7 and  McDonald (Re) , 2014 BCSC  2076 at para. 26. [21]     The central question is whether Ms. Johnson has shown \u201csufficient\u201d cause  to support the order she seeks.  [22]     I accept that there have been issues raised that need some clarification.  Mr. Hanlon initially did not claim in his Statement of Affairs that he  owed any money to his mother and stepfather. He claims he was not aware that  family debts were to be included in his bankruptcy. The circumstances of those  loans and what arrangements, if any, for how they will be repaid is a matter  that merits further investigation.  [23]     It is not entirely clear to what extent there has been some  intermingling of the financial affairs of Mr. Hanlon and his mother but the  evidence does support that he has used her credit card. He says it was only for  a limited purpose but the applicant is entitled to explore this issue further. Mr.  Hanlon admits that his mother provides him with money to pay certain expenses.  He is living with his mother and stepfather in a self-contained bachelor suite.  He is not paying rent.  [24]      The particulars of his income and employment are also unclear. At the  trial, Mr. Hanlon gave sworn evidence he was employed by a Mr. Sadilla of ASIS  Protection, which should reference Mr. Cedilla of ACES Protection, starting in  June, 2017. However, according to a Record of Employment dated May 6, 2019,  Mr. Cedilla indicates that the first day that Mr. Hanlon worked was May  11, 2018. An examination should shed further light on this inconsistency as  well as the allegation made that he is intentionally underemployed. [25]     I am convinced that sufficient cause has been shown by Ms. Johnson to support  an examination of Mr. Hanlon under s. 163(2) of the  BIA.  I am satisfied  that such an examination has the prospect of benefitting the general body of  creditors and it is not a fishing expedition. Accordingly, I order that Mr.  Hanlon attend at an examination at a time and place to be fixed. The  examination will be limited to two hours. The costs of examination and  obtaining a transcript will be borne by Ms. Johnson.  [26]     I am further satisfied that an order should be made that any discharge  hearing take place after the examination of Mr. Hanlon has been completed. In  order that there is no delay I direct that the examination is to be completed  prior to February 28, 2021. Mr. Hanlon is to cooperate in setting a date for  the examination within this time period. The discharge hearing can be scheduled  for a date after the end of February 2021.  [27]     The applicant seeks a broad order for production of documents in the  draft order that was sought. In my view a more productive approach is to have  Ms. Johnson specifically set out the additional documents she is seeking  by way of a letter to Mr. Hanlon, with a copy to the Trustee.  [28]     This letter setting out the particulars of the documents should be  provided at least three weeks before the examination takes place. Mr. Hanlon  will produce the documents he has in his possession or control no later than  seven days prior to the day scheduled for his examination.  [29]     Ms. Johnson seeks the production of Ms. Woods\u2019 will in an attempt to  show that Mr. Hanlon is a beneficiary under it. I assume that she does so in  order to then argue that his potential inheritance should be considered during  the discharge hearing. In the decision of  Eng (Re) , 2014 BCSC 525, Master  Muir, sitting as a Registrar, referenced the  Re Baker  (1987), 63 C.B.R.  (N.S.) 21 decision on the relevance of a potential inheritance. Mr. Justice  Potts states in  Re Baker : 2. In  Re  Stafford   (1959), 37 C.B.R. 206  (Ont.), Smily J. stated at p. 208: I think I may say it is not the  policy of the court, in considering the application of a bankrupt for his  discharge, to take into account the possibility of his inheriting a legacy or  some assets from a relative in the future where that time, in the ordinary  course of events, is not likely to be in the immediate or near future, but  rather, having regard to the usual expectation of life, is probably some  distance from the time of the administration of the bankrupt estate and where  there may never be such inheritance. 3. I agree  with the reasons of Smily, J. Indeed, I would go further. No consideration  should be given to that possibility unless it is a real probability in the  sense that the bankrupt can almost be assured of receiving monies from the  estate of her parents. 4.   In my view there is no reason, in this day and age, why parents or relatives  should, in effect, be held responsible for the debts of their children. [30]     I am not convinced that the production of Ms. Woods\u2019 will should establish  that Mr. Hanlon will be receiving any inheritance. Even if Mr. Hanlon is a  beneficiary under his mother\u2019s will, she is currently alive, and there is no  evidence that he will inherit in the immediate or near future. The evidence  before me establishes that Ms. Woods is married and that some, if not most,  of her assets are owned in joint tenancy with her current husband. Mr. Hanlon  advised that his stepfather is more than ten years younger than his mother. This  does not restrict Ms. Johnson from exploring issues relating to any potential  inheritance at the examination of Mr. Hanlon. [31]     It will be up to the presider of the discharge hearing to ultimately  decide what consideration should be given on any potential inheritance when  determining the conditions of Mr. Hanlon\u2019s discharge.  [32]     I am not satisfied that Ms. Woods should be required to attend an  examination. In my view such an examination would be oppressive in light of  Ms. Woods\u2019 age, being 85 years old, her current health status, and the  current COVID-19 pandemic. I further note in the affidavit of service of  Matthew Gelies, sworn September 17, 2020, he deposes that when he served the  application materials on Ms. Woods she \u201cdid not appear to understand that she  was being served legal documents.\u201d Any questions about the use of her credit  cards by Mr. Hanlon or how Mr. Hanlon is paying for his living expenses  can be canvassed at the examination of Mr. Hanlon. Ms. Johnson\u2019s application to  examine Ms. Woods is dismissed.  [33]     Ms. Johnson is entitled to her costs of this application from Mr.  Hanlon.  \u201cForth  J.\u201d",

        "text": "IN THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA Citation: Farren v. Elite Service Group Inc.,   2020 BCSC 23 Date: 20200109 Docket: S188534 Registry:  Vancouver Between: Kevin Farren Plaintiff And Elite Service  Group Inc. Defendant Before:  The Honourable Justice Iyer Reasons for Judgment The Plaintiff, Appearing in Person: K. Farren Counsel for Defendant: C.R. Wardell Place and Date of Trial: Vancouver, B.C. December 13, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, B.C. January 9, 2020   [1]     In August 2018, Mr. Farren commenced a wrongful dismissal action against  Elite Service Group Inc. (\u201cElite\u201d). Elite now applies for a summary trial on  the issue of whether Mr. Farren is an employee, as he claims, or an independent  contractor, as Elite maintains.  [2]     Elite is a maintenance and repair company. It contracts with the  Starbucks coffee chain to maintain and repair its approximately 1200 Canadian  stores. Its BC office provides these services to approximately 200 stores in  the Vancouver area. The BC office has two employees: an operations manager and  a warehouseman. They work closely with Elite\u2019s main office in Mississauga,  Ontario, which has seven employees.  [3]     Elite\u2019s main services are signage, cleaning and \u201chandy work\u201d, which I  understand to be general maintenance and repair. It contracts with workers to  perform those functions and has approximately 53 such contracts across Canada,  one of which is with Mr. Farren. [4]     Mr. Farren and Elite entered into an oral contract to provide handy work  services commencing January 1, 2018. His contract was terminated without notice  on April 25, 2018, giving rise to the present dispute. [5]     Mr. Farren did not file any response to the present application.  Instead, he asked for an adjournment at the outset of the hearing, saying that  he required more time to get a lawyer and that he had not received the  application materials because they were sent to a defunct email address.  [6]     In fact, Mr. Farren\u2019s previous lawyer withdrew some 11 months ago. The  application materials were sent to Mr. Farren in October at the email address  stipulated as his address for service in an order of this court on January 11,  2019. It is not clear whether Mr. Farren\u2019s email address for service was  defunct at that time, as he appeared in court with the relevant materials. I  denied the adjournment, explaining to Mr. Farren that it is his responsibility  to update his address for service if it changes and that he had had ample time  to find a lawyer.  [7]     The two issues in this application are whether the issue is suitable for  summary trial and, if so, whether Mr. Farren\u2019s relationship with Elite was that  of an employee or an independent contractor. [8]     Before proceeding by summary trial under Rule 9-7, the court must decide  whether the matter is suitable for disposition by summary trial. That is a  discretionary decision. Generally, where the issue(s) can be decided on the  evidence before the court, a summary trial serves the objectives of fair,  speedy and inexpensive determination of the proceeding on its merits: see for  example  Stewart (District) v. Stewart Harbour Authority , 2004 BCSC 8. [9]     As Elite points out, determining the nature of Mr. Farren\u2019s relationship  with Elite will either end the proceedings or substantially simplify the issues  for trial. As Mr. Farren tendered no evidence, there is no conflicting evidence  that might require an assessment of credibility. I find that the issue is  suitable for determination by summary trial. [10]     If Mr. Farren was an employee of Elite, the law of wrongful dismissal would  govern the termination of his employment. In that case, he would be entitled to  reasonable notice of termination or damages in lieu of such notice. The  appropriate remedy would have to be determined in a subsequent proceeding.  However, if Mr. Farren is an independent contractor, he is not entitled to  the remedies he seeks. In that case, his claim should be dismissed: see  Jacks  v. Victoria Amateur Swimming Club,  2005 BCSC 778.  [11]     Recently, in  Lightstream Telecommunications Inc. v. Telecon Inc. ,  2018 BCSC 1940, this court set out a useful list of factors to determine  whether a worker is an independent contractor, based on a review of relevant  case law. Justice Russell grouped the factors as follows (at paras. 124-159) : a)     Level of worker control, including: (1)     Defendant\u2019s control over plaintiff\u2019s activities, including: (a)     Defendant\u2019s power to select or not select the worker, (b)     Payment of wages, (c)     Defendant\u2019s control over method of work, and  (d)     Defendant\u2019s right to suspend or dismiss plaintiff; (2)     Exclusive nature of the relationship; (3)     Plaintiff\u2019s economic dependence on defendant; and (4)     Whether plaintiff could hire their own helpers. b)     Ownership of equipment or tools; c)     Opportunity for profit/loss; d)     Business integration, including: (1)     whether the plaintiff was a crucial element of the defendant\u2019s business, (2)     whether the activity of the worker represents the defendant\u2019s business, (3)     permanency and length of the relationship; and (4)     whether the parties rely on each other or closely co-ordinate conduct [12]     I will apply these factors to the evidence before me. [13]     With respect to worker selection, Elite assigns work to workers such as  Mr. Farren (called \u201cVendors\u201d). Assignments specify the type of work, the  location and the timeframe for completion, usually between 24 hours or five  days. Vendors may accept the assignment, decline it, or request changes. Elite will  then either assign the work to a different Vendor or make the requested change.  Therefore, Elite had a limited power to select Mr. Farren for work. I find that  this sub-factor is neutral.  [14]     With respect to payment of wages, Mr. Farren invoiced through his  company, \u201c101\u201d on its letterhead upon completion of assignments. Like other  Vendors, he charged Elite GST. Elite pays Vendor invoices monthly and does not  make any deductions or remittances from those amounts, such as income tax, CPP,  EI or workers\u2019 compensation. Mr. Farren/101 was Elite\u2019s primary Vendor for  about 20 Starbucks stores in BC and Alberta. Mr. Farren/101 invoiced at rates  set by Elite for labour and specified materials. This method of payment is  characteristic of an independent contractor rather than an employment  relationship. [15]     There is no evidence that Elite trained Mr. Farren to any significant  degree. It provided him with a tablet computer with invoicing software, and a  master key to access Starbucks stores after hours. Jenn Heppner-Palmer, Elite\u2019s  Vancouver operations manager, accompanied Mr. Farren on an initial maintenance  walk-through. She also accompanied Mr. Farren on his first assignment. Other  than that, Mr. Farren performed the work using his pre-existing skill and  expertise. At times, Elite asked Vendors to provide an estimate of the time  and/or cost for completing an assignment. Mr. Farren/101 provided such  estimates.  [16]     Beyond specifying the nature of the work in the work assignment, Elite  exercises little control over how Vendors accomplish their assigned tasks.  Vendors are free to determine when they complete the work within the specified  time range. There is no evidence to support Mr. Farren\u2019s assertion that Ms.  Heppner-Palmer \u201cworked alongside\u201d him. Ms. Heppner-Palmer\u2019s evidence was that  she did not oversee Mr. Farren\u2019s work, but that they would communicate  frequently by phone and text. This sub-factor also points to an independent  contractor relationship. [17]     Elite had the right to terminate Mr. Farren/101\u2019s services and did so on  April 24 or 25, 2019, as a result of a customer complaint. This sub-factor is  neutral. [18]     Elite\u2019s evidence was that Mr. Farren/101 was its primary vendor in the  Vancouver area for the four months he worked with Elite. Elite\u2019s uncontested  evidence was that the relationship was not exclusive and Mr. Farren was free to  take on other work. There is no evidence about whether Mr. Farren took on such  work because he has failed to respond to demands for document disclosure and  requests arising from his discovery. That, coupled with Mr. Farren\u2019s failure to  adduce any evidence about the exclusivity of the relationship, leads me to  conclude that the relationship was not exclusive. [19]     The determination of Mr. Farren\u2019s level of economic dependency on Elite  is also hampered by the lack of evidence from Mr. Farren. Elite\u2019s evidence  shows that Mr. Farren/101 issued approximately 109 invoices to Elite for the  roughly four-month period from January-April 2018, for a total of $18,960,  including GST. Mr. Farren produced an invoice for each assignment. Elite paid  these invoices twice a month. The amounts varied. For example, Mr. Farren\u2019s  invoices for February 2018 totalled $4,883.48 and his invoices for April 2018  totalled $6,618.97. [20]     Mr. Farren submitted that the amount of these invoices establishes his  economic dependence on Elite. I do not agree. Without any evidence about typical  levels of remuneration for this type of work or of Mr. Farren\u2019s financial  circumstances, it is not reasonable to find that Mr. Farren was economically  dependent on Elite in the way an employee is economically dependant on an  employer. [21]     Mr. Farren could and did hire helpers to assist in performing services  for Elite. The evidence shows that Mr. Farren hired a few such individuals,  including his son. Mr. Farren did not separately itemize hours of labour  performed by each individual on his invoices; he simply invoiced Elite for the  total amount of labour performed. I reject Mr. Farren\u2019s assertion that these  individuals were hired by Elite: there is no evidence of this. What evidence  there is, including Mr. Farren\u2019s texts referring to these individuals as \u201chis\u201d  workers, demonstrates that they were not connected to Elite. [22]     In conclusion, the factors relating to the level worker control strongly  point to Mr. Farren being an independent contractor of Elite, not its employee.  While Elite set the rates and defined most job assignments, Mr. Farren was free  to decline them and to stipulate changes. He provided estimates and determined  his own work schedule within timeframes he agreed to with Elite. Elite provided  little training. Mr. Farren/101 invoiced upon completion of each job and  was paid without the usual employee deductions and remittances. There is no  evidence that Mr. Farren was economically dependant on Elite, or that their  relationship was exclusive. Finally, there is evidence that Mr. Farren hired others  and treated them as his own workers. [23]     Apart from a tablet computer and an access card/master key, there is no  evidence that Elite provided any equipment or tools to Mr. Farren. As reflected  in 101\u2019s invoices, Mr. Farren provided his own truck. The invoiced charge for  \u201ctruck\u201d appears to include a number of other supplies, such as \u201cTools \u2013  Sanitary - Drywall tape \u2013 Mud \u2013 Cloth \u2013 Clean up\u201d. This demonstrates that Mr.  Farren used some of his own tools and materials.  [24]     Mr. Farren submitted that Elite supplied all materials, such as tiling.  There is no evidence to this effect. Even assuming that Starbucks, through  Elite, would provide certain materials to maintain the consistent look of its  stores, there is no evidence that anyone other than Mr. Farren provided the  tools to perform the work. This factor also points towards an independent  contractor relationship. [25]     In addition, the nature of the relationship between Mr. Farren and Elite  provided Mr. Farren with some opportunities for profit and loss. Although the  evidence is not comprehensive, it appears that Mr. Farren/101 was paid fixed  rates for certain routine types of work. For example, there was a set minimum  payment for a \u201cwalk-through\u201d. If Mr. Farren could do that work in less than the  minimum time, he would be free to do other things, including other work. Mr.  Farren could and did hire others to do certain work. If he paid them less than  the hourly labour rate he billed to Elite, he could profit. Finally, if Mr.  Farren paid less for material charged to Elite at set rates (for example, the  rate for silicone was $14.00), he could profit. While these amounts might be  small, such opportunities for profit are characteristic of an independent  contractor relationship. [26]     The evidence shows that Mr. Farren was not crucial to Elite\u2019s business. Elite  operates across Canada, servicing around 1200 Starbucks stores. Mr. Farren was  one of 17 handymen, with primary responsibility for handy work on about 20  stores. Elite had others who did the same work as he. He was not irreplaceable  and there is no evidence that his removal materially affected Elite\u2019s  operations.  [27]     Mr. Farren\u2019s activities did not represent Elite\u2019s business in any public  way. He did not wear a uniform or display any other material demonstrating a  relationship to Elite.  [28]     There is no evidence about how long the relationship was intended to  last. In fact, it lasted only four months. [29]     Although there is evidence of communication between Elite and Mr.  Farren, this kind of communication does not amount to coordination in the sense  required by this sub-factor. Ms. Heppner-Palmer deposed that she communicated  with Mr. Farren frequently about potential jobs, as well as his  availability and his progress on any outstanding work. Elite required certain  work to be done within certain time frames. However, it did not rely on Mr.  Farren\u2019s work as part of a wider integrated work process, requiring close  coordination. For example, Elite was not relying on Mr. Farren to complete  a prototype that Elite would then manufacture. Rather, the maintenance and  repair work he performed was routine and repetitive. Beyond needing someone to  perform it in order to fulfil its contract with Starbucks, Elite did not place  any reliance on Mr. Farren or closely coordinate its activities with his. [30]     In summary, there was very little integration of Mr. Farren into Elite\u2019s  business. This factor also points to Mr. Farren being an independent  contractor. [31]     I find that Mr. Farren/101 was an independent contractor in relation to  Elite. Each of the four factors of level of worker control, ownership of  equipment and tools, profit/loss opportunity and business integration support  that conclusion. Considered together, no other conclusion is possible on the  evidence presented. [32]     Elite\u2019s application for summary trial is granted. I find that Mr. Farren  was an independent contractor during the time he provided service to Elite. Mr.  Farren\u2019s action S-188534 against Elite is dismissed, with costs to Elite. \u201cIyer  J.\u201d",

John Doe,   2022 BCCA 33 Date: 20220131 Docket: CA47429 Between: Vitto Chiodo and  Leanne Chiodo Appellants (Plaintiffs) And John Doe and/or  Jane Doe doing business as   Princess Enterprises, Tia Collis Respondents (Defendants) And Westbank  First Nation Intervenor   Before: The Honourable Madam Justice Saunders The Honourable Madam Justice Fenlon The Honourable Mr. Justice Grauer On appeal from: An  order of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, dated   April 12, 2021 ( Chiodo v. Doe , 2021 BCSC 658, Kelowna S126653). Counsel for the Appellants: A.M. Beddoes    J.M. Wiebe Counsel for the Respondents John Doe and/or Jane Doe doing   business as Princess Enterprises: L.C. Glowacki    M.J. Skeels Counsel for the Respondent Tia Collis, appearing via   videoconference: C.J. Wiebe Counsel for the Intervenor: M. Faille    K.B. Brown Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British   Columbia October 22, 2021 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 31, 2022   Written Reasons by: The Honourable Madam Justice Fenlon Concurred in by: The Honourable Madam Justice Saunders The Honourable Mr. Justice Grauer Summary: The appellants appeal from a  decision dismissing their application for judicial review of an arbitrator\u2019s  decision refusing to set aside a notice to end their tenancy. They say the  judge erred in: dismissing the petition for delay, concluding in the  alternative that the arbitrator\u2019s findings were reasonable, and failing to  consider whether the owner had obtained the requisite permits prior to  delivering the notice to end tenancy. Held: Appeal dismissed. The judge  considered the relevant factors in deciding whether a judicial review petition  should be dismissed for unreasonable delay and was alive to the potential  prejudice to the appellants.   Reasons for Judgment of the  Honourable Madam Justice Fenlon: [1]     For more than 18 years the appellants, Vitto and Leanne Chiodo,  rented a mobile home pad from the respondent, Princess Enterprises, which  operates the \u201cShady Rest\u201d mobile home park on Westbank First Nation\u2019s reserve  land on the shores of Lake Okanagan. They used the mobile home as their  vacation property. Unfortunately for the appellants, Princess decided it needed  their lot to access a well adjacent to the property to irrigate the park and  delivered a notice to end tenancy. The Chiodos in turn delivered a notice to  arbitrate, contending that Princess was not acting in good faith and had not  complied with a Westbank First Nation law requiring them to obtain all  necessary project permits before ending a tenancy. The notice to end tenancy was  upheld at arbitration and the appellants failed to overturn that decision on judicial  review. [2]     The appellants contend the reviewing judge erred by: 1. dismissing their  judicial review petition for delay; 2. concluding in the  alternative that the arbitrator\u2019s finding that Princess had terminated the  tenancy in good faith was reasonable; and 3. not considering  whether Princess had obtained all permits and approvals before delivering the  notice to end tenancy. [3]     The first ground of appeal involves a discretionary decision made at  first instance by the reviewing judge and is reviewable on a deferential  standard. In addressing the second and third grounds of appeal, this Court  steps into the shoes of the reviewing judge and applies the appropriate  standard of review to the arbitrator\u2019s decision. [4]     Princess served the notice to end tenancy on January 2, 2018, to  take effect on January 3, 2019. The Chiodos were understandably distressed  by the termination notice. They had done work on the mobile home, had spent summers  there for more than 18 years, and intended to use the premises as their  retirement home. The Chiodos described their lot as a prime location with 150 feet  of beachfront. They applied to an arbitrator under s. 52.1 of the Westbank  First Nation Residential Premises Law No. 2008\u201103,  A Law to  Regulate Residential Premises on Westbank Lands  (22 March 2010) [ RPL ],  which provides: 52.1 A tenant may apply to an  arbitrator for an order setting aside a notice of the end of the tenancy  agreement given or purportedly given under this Law. [5]     An arbitrator dismissed the arbitration on March 16, 2018, but that  initial arbitration decision was overturned on judicial review by Justice  Horsman. Although the Chiodos had waited four months before filing for review, Horsman J.  declined to dismiss the petition for unreasonable delay given the importance of  the matter to the Chiodos. She concluded the arbitrator had erroneously treated  an amended notice to arbitrate as a new notice falling outside the filing  deadline and had improperly dismissed the arbitration for delay. In remitting  the matter for arbitration on the merits, Horsman J. reminded the parties  of the importance of an expeditious process and of her expectation that there  should be no delay in scheduling a new arbitration hearing: 2018 BCSC 2078  at para. 62. [6]     The second arbitration\u2014the one underlying this appeal\u2014was heard by  arbitrator Tia Collis on January 23, 2019. On March 18, 2019, she  upheld the notice to end tenancy, finding that Princess had acted in good faith  and had not failed to obtain necessary permits. On the latter point, Arbitrator  Collis concluded Princess did not need a well license under the  Water  Sustainability Act , S.B.C. 2014, c. 15 [ WSA ] to operate the  well. [7]     Somewhat surprisingly, given their previous experience with an  application to dismiss for delay and Horsman J.\u2019s admonition to proceed  expeditiously, the Chiodos did not apply for leave to review Arbitrator Collis\u2019  decision within the 15\u2011day time limit in the  RPL . Their  application for leave to review the arbitration decision was declined on the  basis that it had been filed 44 days after the decision\u201429 days late. The Chiodos  then waited a further eight months before filing the petition for judicial  review. [8]     The reviewing judge noted that, at common law, the court has discretion  to deny judicial review remedies on the basis of undue delay, a discretion that  has been preserved by s. 8(1) of the  Judicial Review Procedure Act ,  R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 241:  Housewise Construction Ltd. v. Whitgift Holdings Ltd.,   2016 BCSC 2245. She instructed herself on the factors to be considered  in deciding whether a judicial review petition should be dismissed for  unreasonable delay as set out in  Lowe v. Diebolt,  2014 BCCA 280 at para. 46: 1. How does the underlying  administrative scheme operate and what are its objectives?  2. To what extent might  those objectives be undermined by delay? 3. Is the issue brought  forward on the judicial review of critical importance to one or the other  party? 4. Will the delay result  in hardship, prejudice or injustice? 5. What is the effect  of proceeding with judicial review or terminating it on the proper functioning  of the administrative regime? [9]     In addressing the nature of the underlying administrative regime, the  judge noted the short deadlines contained in the  RPL  dispute resolution  process. She found that Westbank First Nation\u2019s success in its real estate  endeavours and in managing its lands was in large part due to an effective and  economical dispute resolution process. She accepted that certainty and finality  were critical values underlying Westbank First Nation\u2019s residential tenancy  legal framework. [10]     The judge addressed the interests of the parties, hardship, and  prejudice collectively, concluding: [47] In all the circumstances,  I do not find that the  petitioners have provided a compelling explanation for the significant delay in  bringing their petition for judicial review . In light of the evidence  provided by WFN about the importance of clarity and certainty to WFN\u2019s ability  to manage its land for the benefit of members and non\u2011member residents  alike, I find that  this is a case where the proper functioning of the  administrative regime weighs heavily . To countenance a complete abandonment  of the timely dispute resolution process set out in the  RPL  would  undermine the proper functioning of this administrative scheme. [Emphasis added.] [11]     Westbank First Nation was granted intervenor status in this appeal to  address the dispute resolution framework. It stressed the importance of the  strict timelines to achieving legal and commercial certainty for all involved\u2014tenants,  landlords, and the Frist Nation itself. [12]     The appellants submit the judge erred because she focused almost  exclusively on the prejudice to Princess and the functioning of the Westbank  First Nation\u2019s administrative regime and did not consider the prejudice to the Chiodos  in dismissing their petition because of delay. They contend this was a  mandatory and significant consideration in the delay assessment and that the  judge\u2019s failure to engage in a detailed analysis of potential prejudice to the Chiodos\u2014from  dismissing what might be a meritorious judicial review\u2014constitutes a clear  error of law. [13]     I would not accede to this argument. Although the judge did not  expressly describe the nature of the prejudice to the appellants, this was a  case in which the prejudice was obvious, driving as it did the entire legal  proceeding. The appellants were fighting the notice to end tenancy because they  were about to lose a vacation home they had enjoyed for more than 18 years. [14]     In addition, at para. 42 of her reasons, the judge referred to that  part of Horsman J.\u2019s reasons on the earlier judicial review in which she  addressed prejudice to the appellant. In part, Horsman J. had stated: [41] First, this petition  is of obvious importance to the Petitioners who risk losing the vacation home  they have had for over 18 years, and simply seek a hearing of the merits  of their dispute of the Notice before the tenancy terminates. It would work a  significant unfairness to the Petitioners to dismiss a meritorious application  for judicial review on the basis of a delay that cannot be characterized as  inordinate. [15]     A judge is not required to describe every step in their reasoning  process; it is sufficient if the basis for a decision is discernible from the  reasons read in the context of the record:  R. v. R.E.M ., 2008  SCC 51 at para. 24. In my view, the judge\u2019s reasons demonstrate that  she was alive to, and weighed, the prejudice to the appellants if the judicial  review was dismissed for delay, but found it was insufficient to offset the  countervailing consideration of eight month\u2019s delay\u2014a delay she found the  appellants had failed to explain. [16]     Nor do I agree with the appellants\u2019 submission that the judge  misunderstood their explanation for the delay. In his affidavit filed in  support of the petition, Mr. Chiodo said he \u201cdid not want to go to the  expense and inconvenience of making a [judicial review] application if in fact  Princess obtained a well license\u201d and that \u201c[in] order to make that  determination it was necessary to \u2026 try to determine the status of the well  application\u201d. He stated that his lawyer at the time informed him that he had  made \u201ctelephone inquiries on February 4, 2020 [and] \u2026 the well license  application \u2026 was not approved.\u201d [17]     The judge understood Mr. Chiodo\u2019s evidence to be that he was told  on February 4 that the license application was not  yet  approved,  questioning how \u201c the current status of any applications  by [Princess],  as revealed by an FOI request would \u2026 in any way alleviate [the Chiodos\u2019]  stated concern that, if [Princess was] found to require a permit [under the  WSA ] , [Princess] could simply apply for a permit  and then start the eviction process all over again\u201d (emphasis added): at para. 46. [18]     The appellants submit the judge failed to appreciate that Princess\u2019  application for a permit had been  denied , so erroneously reasoned that  it was still open to Princess to apply for and obtain a permit if one was found  to be required. The appellants contend that if the judge had appreciated that  Princess\u2019 application for a permit under the  WSA  had been rejected, and  that they had filed their petition one week after learning this, \u201cthe Decision  may well have been different \u2026 the Chambers Judge\u2019s reasons for being  dissatisfied with the Chiodos\u2019 explanation would have fallen away.\u201d [19]     With respect, it appears to be the appellants who have misapprehended  the record. Mr. Chiodo\u2019s affidavit does not say that his lawyer told him Princess\u2019  application had been denied. He states only that he was told it \u201cwas not  approved.\u201d The manager for the mobile home park, Mr. Osberg, provided  direct evidence in his affidavit sworn March 9, 2020, responding to Mr. Chiodo\u2019s  affidavit, and in support of Princess\u2019 response to the petition for judicial  review, deposed that a determination  had not yet been made  on the  application. [20]     It was thus open to the judge to conclude that all Mr. Chiodo learned  on February 4 was that the  WSA  permit had not yet been approved. I  see no error in the judge\u2019s understanding of Mr. Chiodo\u2019s explanation for  the delay in filing for judicial review, nor do I see any error in her  conclusion that the explanation was inadequate. [21]     I note as well that the arbitrator concluded Princess did not need a  WSA   permit, both because the  WSA  provided for a permit\u2011free three\u2011year  transition period, and because of the inapplicability of the  WSA  to  reserve lands. Even if Princess\u2019 application had been denied, the arbitrator\u2019s conclusion  that a  WSA  permit was  not  required would have to be challenged  before Princess\u2019s inability to obtain a permit could have any relevance to the  validity of the notice to end tenancy. [22]     In conclusion, I see no basis upon which this Court could interfere with  the judge\u2019s exercise of her discretion to dismiss the judicial review for  unreasonable delay. [23]     Having come to that conclusion, it is not necessary to address the  second and third grounds of appeal. For the benefit of Mr. and Ms. Chiodo,  however, I will consider these grounds briefly. [24]     In my view, the arbitrator\u2019s conclusions that Princess issued the notice  to end tenancy in good faith, and that a permit was not required under the  WSA ,  were reasonable ones. This was not a case in which the appellants put forward conflicting  evidence on the good faith issue; they simply challenged Princess\u2019 reasons for  wanting to take over their lot, suggesting they were illogical, and that  Princess really wanted to rent the premises to someone else. The arbitrator correctly  identified the law on good faith. She reviewed Princess\u2019 evidence and its  reasons for developing the well and found them to be credible. The arbitrator  therefore found Princess had acted in good faith. In the context of this case, the  judge\u2019s reasons were sufficient and were not conclusory. [25]     As for the third ground of appeal\u2014that the arbitrator\u2019s decision should  be quashed because she did not consider whether permits other than the  WSA   license had to be obtained before the notice to end tenancy could be issued\u2014those  matters were not argued before the arbitrator, and her decision cannot  therefore be found to be unreasonable for failing to consider them. As this Court  observed in  Vandale v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Tribunal , 2013 BCCA 391: [54] \u2026 To allow a party a  new hearing before an administrative tribunal because it overlooked raising an  issue or making an argument at the original hearing would unduly interfere with  the role entrusted to such tribunals:  Alberta Teachers\u2019 Association  at para. 24.  In effect, the tribunal\u2019s decision would be set aside not because it failed to  pass scrutiny under the applicable standard of review, but because it did not  address a point it was not asked to address. [26]     A judge on judicial review has discretion to entertain new arguments but  generally will not do so if the issue could have been, but was not, raised  before the tribunal:  Alberta (Information and Privacy Commissioner) v.  Alberta Teachers\u2019 Association , 2011 SCC 61 at para. 23. I note  that quite apart from the limited role of a reviewing court in administrative  matters, which militates against addressing new issues, the respondent in this  case would be prejudiced if that course were followed. The environmental  assessment framework the appellants wish to rely on would require factual  context to resolve\u2014context that was not addressed at the arbitration. [27]     In conclusion, I would dismiss the appeal with costs to Princess  Enterprises. No award of costs is made either for or against the intervenor. \u201cThe  Honourable Madam Justice Fenlon\u201d I AGREE: \u201cThe Honourable Madam Justice  Saunders\u201d I AGREE: \u201cThe Honourable Mr. Justice  Grauer\u201d",

        "text": "IN THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA Citation: British Columbia (Director of Civil Forfeiture) v. Vu,   2020 BCSC 106 Date: 20200103 Docket: S181868 Registry:  Victoria Civil  Forfeiture Action in Rem Against The  Lands and Structures situated at 6428 Bella Vista Drive,   Victoria, British Columbia and having a Legal Description of PID 015-120-341,  Lot 16, Plan VIP49441, Section 16, Range 4E, South Saanich Land District and its  fruits and proceeds, and $11,100.00 in Canadian currency seized by the CSPD  from 6428 Bella Vista Drive, Victoria, British Columbia on March 28, 2018, and  its proceeds Between: Director of Civil  Forfeiture Plaintiff And The Owners and all  Others Interested in the Property and/or Money, in Particular,  Dinh Hao Vu Defendant Before:  The Honourable Madam Justice Jackson Oral Reasons for Judgment Counsel for Plaintiff: L. F. de Lima Counsel for Defendant: A. Huynh Place and Date of Hearing: Victoria, B.C. December 20, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: Victoria, B.C. January 3, 2020   [1]     These are my reasons for judgment in this matter. If a transcript is  ordered I may make stylistic or grammatical changes but they will not affect  the substance of my reasons and decision. [2]     There are two applications before me for determination. [3]     In the first, Dinh Hao Vu (the \u201cApplicant\u201d) seeks an order pursuant to  Supreme  Court Civil Rules , B.C. Reg. 168/2009, R. 12-5(67), that the question of  whether the Applicant\u2019s rights under s. 8 of the  Canadian Charter of  Rights and Freedoms  have been violated as a result of the search and  seizure of the premises at 6428 Bella Vista Drive, Victoria, BC V8Z 7G6, and  the corresponding remedy for the alleged  Charter  breaches, be heard  prior to and separately from the remaining issues in the notice of civil claim  brought by the Director of Civil Forfeiture (the \u201cDirector\u201d) (the \u201cBifurcation  Application\u201d). [4]     If the Applicant is successful in the Bifurcation Application, the  Applicant seeks consequential further relief deferring examination for  discovery and document production until after the determination of the  Charter   issues, or in the alternative that such discovery be limited in scope to the  Charter   issues. If the Applicant is successful in his Bifurcation Application, the  Director does not oppose the consequential relief the Applicant seeks. [5]     If the Applicant is unsuccessful in the Bifurcation Application, in the  second application, the Director seeks disclosure and discovery orders against  the Applicant (the \u201cDisclosure Application\u201d). While not consenting to the  Director\u2019s Disclosure Application, the Applicant concedes that if he is  unsuccessful in his Bifurcation Application there would be no basis not to  grant the relief the Director seeks.  [6]     For the purposes of the Bifurcation Application, the Director concedes  the Applicant had some reasonable expectation of privacy, and has standing to  bring his application. [7]     The Director challenges the admissibility of the evidence for three  reasons. [8]     The Director argues that both affidavits filed by the Applicant are  inadmissible because they contain no reference to the Applicant\u2019s use of a  translator. At paragraph 10 of the Applicant\u2019s affidavit made on July 8, 2019  (the \u201cFirst Affidavit\u201d), the Applicant deposes that: On March 31, 2018, I attended the  CSPS station, where Sergeant Haney interviewed me and my son was in attendance,  acting as the translator. I was told after the interview by my son that he  believes he did not accurately translate the statements made by Sergeant Haney.  Sergeant Haney also continued to ask questions after I requested that the  interview cease. [9]     The inference to be drawn from this paragraph is that the Applicant is  asserting he requires the assistance of an English language translator.  However, the First Affidavit as well as the Applicant\u2019s affidavit made July 17,  2019 (the \u201cSecond Affidavit\u201d), are in English. There is no reference in either  affidavit to any translator being used. When this apparent anomaly was raised  by counsel for the Director, counsel for the Applicant advised that she had  translated the First Affidavit and the Second Affidavit for the Applicant, contrary  to the requirement of  Supreme Court Civil Rules , R. 22-2(7). The  Director argues both affidavits are inadmissible on the basis that they do not  contain the required certification of a translator. The Director further argues  that, even if the affidavits had included the requisite certification of  translation, the Applicant\u2019s counsel would not be considered an impartial  translator and the reliability that flows from the use of an independent  translator would be absent:  Luu v. Wang , 2011 BCSC 1201 at paras. 8-15.   [10]     Relying on R. 22-2(14), counsel for the Applicant argues the absence of  any indication that the affidavits were the product of a translation is simply  \u201can irregularity in its form\u201d and that the affidavits should nonetheless be  admitted. [11]     I do not consider failing to provide any indication that the First  Affidavit and the Second Affidavit where the product of a translation to be a  mere \u201cirregularity in its form\u201d. This is particularly so where it appears that  the Applicant\u2019s ability to speak and understand English could be a fact of some  significance in the proceedings. I consider the absence of information that the  affidavits were prepared based on a translation to be a serious breach of the  Rules .  In my view, neither of the affidavits are admissible. [12]     Given my conclusion that the First Affidavit and the Second Affidavit  are inadmissible on the basis that they violate the  Rules , specifically  those governing the requirements of translated affidavits, it is not necessary  for me to address the Director\u2019s other two objections in detail. I will simply  state that I would also exclude the Applicant\u2019s Second Affidavit on the basis  that it violates the rule against splitting one\u2019s case, which applies even in  chambers applications where the respondent has not filed any affidavit  material, as was the case before me:  The Owners, Strata Plan KAS 2971 v.  American Bankers Insurance Company of Florida , 2016 BCSC 581 at paras. 28-31.  An applicant is obliged to present all of his evidence in support of an  application at the outset and cannot only partially present his evidence and  then attempt to fill in any evidentiary gaps identified in the respondent\u2019s  application response with further affidavit evidence when the respondent has  filed no affidavit evidence to which the applicant can reply:  A.P. v. D.S. ,  [1998] B.C.J. No. 348 at para. 13;  Fast Trac Bobcat &  Excavating Service v. Riverfront Corporate Centre , 2008 BCSC 848 at para. 3.  Although the Applicant relies on  Woo v. ONNI Ioco Road Five Development  Limited Partnership , 2012 BCSC 1445, at para. 35 Justice Pearlman  refers to the affidavits to which objection had been taken, as \u201creply\u201d  affidavits, which suggests to me responding affidavits had been filed. That is  distinguishable from the situation before me. The fact that the Applicant filed  the Bifurcation Application in an attempt to ameliorate the splitting of his  case after the issue was drawn to his attention by counsel for the Director,  does not alter my conclusion. In my view, it would be an abusive process to  permit the Applicant to proceed as he did. [13]     I would also accede to the Director\u2019s argument that exhibits \u201cD\u201d and \u201cE\u201d  of the Applicant\u2019s First Affidavit are inadmissible for the purpose of  establishing the distance between the Property and another house. Exhibits \u201cD\u201d  and \u201cE\u201d are two pages which bear the Google trademark, show a map of some type,  are largely illegible, include information which is inconsistent with the  submissions made on behalf of the Applicant, are undated and include no legend  to even partially explain the information the pages contain. There is not even  any evidence from the Applicant in the body of the affidavit that attempts to  explain or interpret the information the documents are alleged to provide.  Exhibits \u201cD\u201d and \u201cE\u201d provide no reliable probative evidence:  R. v. Quiring ,  2019 SKQB 125 at paras. 22-29. I would rule them inadmissible on that  basis as well. [14]     Given my ruling that the Applicant\u2019s First Affidavit and Second  Affidavit are inadmissible, and there being no other evidence before the Court,  it follows that the Bifurcation Application must be dismissed. However, in the  event that I am wrong regarding the admissibility of the affidavit evidence, I  will nonetheless address the merits of the Applicant\u2019s Bifurcation Application. [15]     As a starting point, the presumption is that \u201call claims should be  brought and adjudicated at one time\u201d:  Brennand v. Sun Life Assurance Company  of Canada , 2011 BCSC 759 at para. 22. [16]     However, the court has the discretion to order bifurcation where there  are extraordinary, exceptional or compelling reasons to bifurcate or a real  likelihood of significant savings in time or expense:  Civil Forfeiture  (Director) v. Johnson , 2015 BCSC 1217 at para. 53;  Director of  Civil Forfeiture v. Huynh , 2012 BCSC 740 at para. 24, citing  Bramwell  v. Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority , 2008 BCSC 1180 at paras. 11-12;   British Columbia (Civil Forfeiture) v. Liu , 2019 BCSC 779 at para. 6.  It is the second prong of this test on which the Applicant relies. See  Huynh   at para. 25;  Liu  at para. 27. [17]     The test for review of a search warrant is \u201cwhether there was reliable evidence  that might reasonably be believed on the basis of which the authorization could  have issued, not whether in the opinion of the reviewing judge, the application  should have been granted at all by the authorizing judge\u201d (emphasis in  original):  R. v. Araujo , 2000 SCC 65 at para. 54. On this  Bifurcation Application, \u201cI am required to assess, to a very limited extent and  taking care not to embarrass the trial judge in his or her ultimate analysis,  the likelihood that the evidence of the search will be excluded and the effect  that such exclusion would have on the continuation of the action\u201d:  Huynh   at para. 25. In other words, given my consideration is a preliminary  assessment of the Applicant\u2019s argument regarding the alleged breach of his  s. 8  Charter  rights, I am to undertake a very limited review of the  evidence and determine whether there is a \u201creal likelihood\u201d the trial judge  would: 1)   find the  information to obtain the warrant (\u201cITO\u201d), as amplified if appropriate, could  not provide \u201creasonable grounds to believe\u201d (being the standard set out in  s. 11(1) of the  Controlled Drugs and Substances Act , S.C. 1996,  c. 19) an offence had been committed and that evidence was to be found at  the residence; and  2)   exclude the  evidence obtained in the search. [18]     Review of the warrant begins from the presumption of validity:  R. v.  Sadikov , 2014 ONCA 72 at para. 83.  [19]     The Applicant submits that \u201cno justice acting judicially could have  granted the search warrant in this case had the justice known all the facts  known to the affiant who swore the ITO at the time it was sworn, and had not  been materially misled by some of the information presented in the ITO.\u201d [20]     Relying on  R. v. Garofoli , [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1421;  R. v. Araujo ;   R. v. Morelli , 2010 SCC 8;  R. v. Campbell , 2011 SCC 32, the  Applicant argues that a number of pieces of information in the ITO were  misleading (or, in the words of counsel for the Applicant, \u201cpotentially\u201d  misleading) and some pieces of information were omitted from the ITO, which  should not have been, and which represent a failure to make full and frank  disclosure. The Applicant argues it is \u201cin the interests of justice\u201d to  bifurcate the proceeding and try the  Charter  issues first:  British  Columbia (Director of Civil Forfeiture) v. Cronin , 2016 BCSC 284 at para. 37.  He argues doing so \u201cmay result in dismissal of the [Director\u2019s] claims, should  the  Charter  breaches be proven.\u201d  [21]     As my assessment at this preliminary stage is to be very limited, I will  not make extensive comments with respect to the specific complaints of the  Applicant with respect to the ITO. Rather, I will simply set out general  principles which I view as responsive to the concerns the Applicant raised. [22]     First, an ITO must be viewed holistically and in its entirety, and not  considered word by word or line by line in isolation:  R. v. Rossiter ,  2006 BCPC 306, [2006] B.C.J No. 1488 at paras. 18, 20, citing  HMTQ  v. Maxwell , 2004 BCSC 1200 at paras. 34-35;  R. v. Beren and Swallow ,  2005 BCSC 1633 at para. 46.  [23]     Hearsay can be relied on to support a belief there are reasonable  grounds to issue a warrant:  R. v. Montgomery , 2016 BCCA 379 at para. 123.   [24]     The affiant of an ITO is entitled to draw and articulate reasonable  inferences based on articulated facts:  R. v. Nguyen , 2014 ONSC 4230 at para. 41. [25]     Expert evidence is not required to understand Hydro electrical data or  draw inferences from it:  Nguyen  at paras. 55, 83, 88. I do not read   R. v. Gauthier and Pleice , 2012 BCSC 2233, as being inconsistent with  that statement of the law. In Gauthier it appears that Justice Leask\u2019s concern  was that the affiant of the ITO provided an expert opinion about Hydro  requirements of indoor cannabis marijuana grow operations without a basis for  an expertise being articulated in the ITO. The Hydro information in the ITO in  this case dealt with household consumption which is a matter within the common  knowledge of a trier of fact and does not require expert opinion evidence.  Further, the affiant of the ITO in this case articulated the basis for the  knowledge of the Hydro information provided. Counsel for the Director brought  to my attention the decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in  R.  v. Dellapenna,  [1995] B.C.J. No. 1526 (C.A.). However, I agree with  him that there is a basis upon which it can be distinguished from the  circumstances of this case. In  Dellapenna , it appears the Court\u2019s  concern was that the affiant of the ITO had stated his opinion without setting  out its foundation, and on review the foundation was tenuous (at paras. 16,  35).  [26]     Finally, a failure to make full and frank disclosure, without more, does  not invalidate a warrant:  R. v. Frederickson , 2018 BCCA 2 at para. 31.  By making this comment I do not wish to be understood as suggesting there was a  failure to make full and frank disclosure in the ITO. [27]     Assuming the amplified record for which the Applicant advocates,  excising some information and adding others, I am not satisfied the there is a  real likelihood the trial judge would find the warrant could not have issued.  In addition, the Applicant made no submissions in support of any argument that  there is a real likelihood the trial judge would exclude evidence that resulted  from a breach of the Applicant\u2019s s. 8  Charter  rights.  [28]     In all the circumstances, I am unable to conclude there is a real  likelihood bifurcation could resolve the case, thereby saving substantial time  and expense. I would therefore decline to exercise my discretion to bifurcate  the proceedings as requested by the Applicant.  [29]     For all of the above reasons the Applicant\u2019s Bifurcation Application is  dismissed. [30]     As noted earlier in these reasons, counsel for the Applicant  acknowledged that if the Bifurcation Application was unsuccessful there was no  basis not to grant the relief sought by the Director in the Disclosure  Application. I am satisfied the order sought with respect to an amended list of  documents, as set out in paragraph 1 of the Disclosure Application is warranted  and appropriate. The order sought in the Director\u2019s Disclosure Application is  granted on the terms set out therein.  [31]     The Director was the successful party in both applications. Costs are  payable by the Applicant to the Director. \u201cJackson  J.\u201d",

Respondent Corrected  Judgment: The front page of the judgment was corrected on February 14, 2022. Corrected Judgment:  Reference to the childrens\u2019 birthdays at para. 2 have been changed to  [birthday] on February 14, 2022. Before:  The Honourable Justice Lamb Oral Ruling Re Application for an Order Pursuant to  s. 61(2)(c) for Compensatory Parenting Time In  Chambers Counsel for the Claimant: K.W. Wince Counsel for the Respondent: F. Jhuty appearing  as agent for   M. Mand Place and Date of Hearing: New Westminster, B.C. January 6, 2022 Place and Date of Judgment: New Westminster, B.C. January 7, 2022   [1]     THE COURT:  In this family law action the claimant, A.S., seeks  an order pursuant to s. 61(2)(c) for compensatory parenting time to make  up for parenting time that the respondent, J.A., would not allow him to  exercise. Mr. S also seeks an order pursuant to s. 61(2)(g) that Ms. A  pay a nominal fine for wrongfully denying his parenting time. [2]     The parties started living together on June 1, 2008, and were married on  August 11, 2012. The parties separated on September 9, 2019. There are two  children of the marriage: G, born [birthday]; and J, born [birthday].  [3]     Mr. S filed a notice of family claim on May 29, 2020, seeking  a shared parenting arrangement and other relief.  [4]     On October 1, 2020, Mr. S brought a contested application for  parenting time that was heard before Justice Duncan. On October 13, 2020,  Justice Duncan made an interim parenting order that gave the parties joint  parenting responsibilities for the children's health with a requirement to  consult, and Ms. A was given the deciding vote in the event of the parties  not agreeing. Justice Duncan ordered gradually increasing parenting time for Mr. S.  He was entitled to parenting time on Wednesdays from 4:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.,  and the parties have agreed that he will have parenting time every second  weekend from Friday to Sunday evening. [5]     Justice Duncan also made the following orders: Para. 5: If there was a report of  a COVID\u201119 case at the school where Mr. S works, then his parenting  time would be suspended until he provides proof that he tested negative for  COVID\u201119.  Para. 6: Both parties will  continue to minimize contact between the Children and anyone outside the  immediate family. \"Immediate family\" was defined to include both sets  of grandparents.  [6]     Paragraph 7 of Justice Duncan's order provided that if Mr. S's  parents had an exchange student living with them, then the student would not be  part of the family contact group, and Mr. S's parents would be required to  wear masks while spending time with the Children. [7]     Justice Duncan's order remains in full force and effect, though the  parties agreed to a consent order that has been submitted for filing but not  yet entered that varies Justice Duncan's order. The consent order removes the  requirement that Mr. S have a negative COVID\u201119 test (para. 5),  and once the children are double vaccinated, removes the restrictions on  contacts (para. 6 and 7). The children received their first vaccine on  November 30, 2021, and Ms. A expects they will have their second vaccine  in February 2022. [8]     It is because of her concerns around the COVID\u201119 pandemic that Ms. A  refused to allow Mr. S to exercise his parenting time on December 1,  2021, and has continued to refuse his having parenting time since then, aside  from a two\u2011hour visit on Christmas Day. Ms. A says that she believes  that it is in the best interests of the children's health and in particular J's  health to discontinue Mr. S's parenting time until the children have  received their second vaccine. Ms. A relies on s. 62(1)(f) and says  that the denial of parenting time was not wrongful because she properly  exercised her parenting responsibility for J's health.  [9]     To place Ms. A's perspective in context, I will briefly review J's  medical history. In October 2017, at age three, J spent six days in Royal  Inland Hospital with a diagnosis of croup. In March 2019, J had another episode  of croup that sent him to the emergency department. In anticipation of the  interim parenting application and at Ms. A's request, J's family doctor  prepared a letter dated June 22, 2020, to explain J's health and how the COVID\u201119  pandemic affects his health. The family doctor stated that J is an otherwise  healthy child but that he was hospitalized for two episodes of croup, which is  a respiratory illness caused by a virus or bacteria. [10]     In terms of the impact of the pandemic on J, the family doctor explained  there was limited information at that time with regards to risk factors for developing  severe disease, but \"croup is a respiratory illness that may pose [\u2026] a  higher risk.\" In terms of recommendations to be followed in regard to J  or both children, the family doctor offered the standard public health  recommendations such as washing hands, physical distancing and wearing a mask. The  family doctor also said this: To further reduce risk of  transmission, it has been recommended to reduce the number of interactions  between individuals. For example, Dr. Bonnie Henry recommends staying in  your current bubble and not expanding to others. This is in reference to  staying with whom they currently reside. This is to protect against  transmission from one home to another. [11]     I note that even when specifically asked, the family doctor did not  recommend that special restrictions beyond the public health guidelines were  required to account for J's medical history. [12]     J's history of being hospitalized for croup and the family doctor's  letter dated June 22, 2020, were included as part of the evidence on the  interim parenting application. Based on all the evidence before her, Justice  Duncan did not order that Mr. S needed to limit his contacts with others  or to observe particular conduct guidelines as a condition of his parenting  time. Justice Duncan ordered that the parties would continue to minimize the  contacts that the children had with anyone outside the immediate family, but  she did not place any such restrictions on Mr. S's contacts or on Ms. A's  contacts for that matter. As noted in her response to this application: [Ms. A] has chosen to  follow extremely strict self\u2011isolating protocols to ensure the health and  safety of the children. [13]     In her response, she lists various concerns that she has about Mr. S's  conduct. For example, the trigger for her refusing parenting time on  December 1, 2020, was Mr. S's visit to his brother's house a few days  prior. Based on Mr. S's evidence, I accept that his visit to his brother  complied with public health orders in effect at the time. As for the other  concerns identified by Ms. A, I am not convinced that any of them when  viewed objectively and reasonably would justify withholding the parenting time  granted in the October 2020 order on medical grounds. [14]     Ms. A says that a letter dated December 18, 2021, from the same  family physician who wrote the June 2020 letter provides justification for  withholding parenting time for medical reasons. I disagree. The family doctor  noted that as new variants such as Omicron emerge, there are concerns about  increased transmissibility and severity of illness. She repeats her comment  that \"croup is a respiratory illness that may pose a higher risk\" and  acknowledges that J may be at greater risk of hospitalization than the average  child if he were to acquire COVID\u201119. [15]     When specifically asked whether J needs to be fully vaccinated before  increasing exposure to others, the family doctor referred to the BC Centre For  Disease Control, Ministry of Health and Public Health Officer guidelines. When  asked for recommendations in regard to whether there is anything specific that J's  parents should do given J's health and the COVID\u201119 pandemic, the family  doctor repeated her recommendations from her June 2020 letter. In other words,  despite very pointed questions, the family doctor did not recommend or advise  more restrictions on conduct or contacts for J or his family than are provided  for in public health guidelines. In particular, the family doctor did not  recommend that the parties needed to follow \"extremely strict self\u2011isolating  protocols\" to better ensure J's health and safety. [16]     As another reason to limit J's contact with Mr. S, Ms. A  points to some orthodontic work that J is scheduled to have in January 2022,  saying it will have to be delayed if J contracts COVID\u201119. Again, the  family doctor has not recommended any enhanced health precautions for J. Anticipated  orthodontic work does not constitute a medical reason to deprive the children  of parenting time with their father. [17]     In summary, the ultimate authority to make decisions about the  children's health granted to Ms. A on an interim basis does not give her  the right to override the order for parenting time when there are no new  recommendations for protecting J\u2019s health and there is no cogent basis to  conclude that Mr. S is contravening the recommendations from J's family  doctor, which are essentially to follow public health guidelines. [18]     In considering whether Ms. A has wrongfully denied parenting time  to Mr. S, I have considered what Justice Betton said at para. 57 of   K.R. v. J.W. , 2016 BCSC 225, about the purpose and effect of ss. 61  and 62 of the  Family Law Act,  S.B.C. 2011, c. 25.: [57] Parenting time that has  been included in an agreement or that has been ordered must be respected. If  not appealed or varied, compliance cannot be viewed as optional\u2026. Section 62  ensures reasonable denials are permitted, again consistent with the best  interests of the children being the only consideration. [19]     I am satisfied that Mr. S has met the onus on him to establish that  Ms. A has wrongfully denied him parenting time. Pursuant to s. 61(2)(c)  of the  Family Law Act , Mr. S will have compensatory parenting time  with the children, G and J. He has now missed three weekend visits with the  children. Ms. S will have his usual parenting time with the children, that  is Friday evening to Sunday evening, for the next six consecutive weekends  starting this weekend before resuming the usual alternating weekend schedule. If  both parties agree in writing, Mr. S may exercise his compensatory weekend  parenting time sometime other than over the next six weeks. [20]     Mr. S has also missed a total of 18 hours of parenting time by  virtue of missing six Wednesday afternoon parenting time periods. Mr. S is  entitled to compensatory parenting time that he may exercise on a statutory  holiday or a professional development day or other weekday when the children  are not in school. His weekday compensatory time may be exercised over at most  three different weekdays. Mr. S may choose the weekday on which he will  exercise this additional time by notifying Ms. A in writing at least a  week in advance. [21]     I am satisfied that it is appropriate in these circumstances to order Ms. A  to pay a fine pursuant to s. 61(2)(g) in the amount of $10 payable forthwith.   [SUBMISSIONS ON COSTS] [22]     THE COURT: I appreciate that your client has some financial challenges.  I am satisfied, though, in this case that Mr. S has been largely  successful or very successful on this application and has established that your  client did wrongfully deny parenting time.  [23]     I am concerned that even after attempts to resolve this on Mr. S's  part by engaging with Ms. A that he was deprived of parenting time in  particular over the winter break when he might have had extra time during the  day, and that rather than bringing an application to vary the order, your  client unilaterally made decisions about parenting time. [24]     I am satisfied in these circumstances, given that Mr. S was put to  the expense of having to bring this application in order to get any parenting  time at all, that he is entitled to costs in any event of the cause. [25]     Again, as I have said in the order, that these terms in terms of the  make\u2011up time can be varied by consent in writing between the parties. I  am not precluding that, and I expect that Mr. S will continue in the way  that he has before in exercising his parenting time. That is my expectation. Mr. S  is entitled to compensatory weekend time starting this weekend, and he has  three make\u2011up weekends, which will be exercised consecutively over the  next six weeks, unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. \u201cLamb J.\u201d",

(Re),   2022 BCSC 62 Date: 20220111 Docket: B210542 Registry:  Vancouver In  Bankruptcy and Insolvency   In the Matter of  the Bankruptcy of 1449 Sandhurst Place Holdings Ltd.   Before:  The Honourable Mr. Justice Milman Oral Reasons for Judgment Counsel for the Applicant, Jeana Ventures Ltd.: P.J. Reardon Counsel for the Debtor, 1449 Sandhurst Place Holdings Ltd.: H.A. Frydenlund Counsel for the Attendee, ADC Holdings Ltd.: M.C. Sennott Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, B.C. January 7, 2022 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, B.C. January 11, 2022   [1]     This is an application for a bankruptcy order under s. 43 of the  Bankruptcy  and Insolvency Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. B-5 [ BIA ]. The applicant, Jeana  Ventures Ltd. (\u201cJeana\u201d) is a shareholder of the debtor, a company called 1449  Sandhurst Place Holdings Ltd. (\u201cSandhurst\u201d). The application is opposed by  Sandhurst\u2019s other shareholder, ADC Projects Ltd. (\u201cADC\u201d). ADC holds 51% of the  shares in Sandhurst in trust for Jeana. [2]     Sandhurst is a single-purpose entity that, until recently, held title to  an investment property in West Vancouver. The relationship between the two  shareholders has broken down and they have been and continue to be embroiled in  other litigation concerning Sandhurst and its affairs, among other things. It  is that other litigation that forms the basis of ADC\u2019s opposition to this  application. [3]     Jeana says that Sandhurst owes it a debt in excess of $1,000 and has committed  an act of bankruptcy in the last six months, thereby satisfying the conditions  for a bankruptcy order under that provision. The act of bankruptcy alleged is  that Sandhurst has ceased to pay its liabilities as they become due. Those  liabilities include, primarily, a shareholder loan owing to Jeana in the amount  of $1,714,497 plus interest and costs, of which $545,267 is said to be secured  by way of a mortgage. Jeana also alleges that Sandhurst has failed to pay two  higher ranking mortgages and a lien claim that had, until recently, encumbered  title to the West Vancouver property that was Sandhurst\u2019s main asset. [4]     I say \u201cuntil recently\u201d because, in other litigation, ADC sought a  winding-up order in relation to Sandhurst under s. 324 of the  Business Corporations  Act , S.B.C. 2002, c. 57. In that proceeding, Horsman J. made an order  placing Sandhurst into receivership. The receiver has since sold the investment  property. The two mortgages ranking ahead of Jeana\u2019s indebtedness have been  paid in full from the proceeds of sale. The lien has been discharged. [5]     By order made by Coval J. on October 6, 2021, the receiver was permitted  to pay the balance left after payment of various administrative and  receivership costs, being a net sum of $543,048.10, to Jeana\u2019s lawyers in  trust, once the receiver is satisfied that no funds are owing to the Canada  Revenue Agency (\u201cCRA\u201d). [6]     Jeana is seeking a bankruptcy order so that it can reverse the  priorities and be paid those funds now, ahead of any claim on them that may be  advanced by the CRA. Jeana cites  Bank of Montreal v. Scott Road Enterprises  Ltd ., (1989) 36 B.C.L.R. (2d) 118 (C.A.), as authority for the proposition  that this is a valid and proper purpose for seeking a bankruptcy order. [7]     ADC disputes that Jeana is a creditor of Sandhurst with standing to  bring this application. According to ADC, it and Jeana are parties to a shareholders\u2019  agreement that contains a shotgun buyout clause. That clause is said to permit  either shareholder to force a buyout of the shares and shareholder loans held  by the other shareholder. Jeana says that it duly triggered that clause on  October 20, 2020 and that, consequently, Jeana has been obliged since then to  sell to ADC its shares and its shareholder loan position for $800,000, but it  has refused to do so.  [8]     Jeana denies that the shotgun buyout clause was properly invoked. It has  commenced its own action against ADC, arguing that ADC and its principal are  guilty of serious breaches of fiduciary duty, including misappropriation of  funds and various fraudulent acts in relation to the Sandhurst venture and  other business they have been involved in together. ADC has brought a  counterclaim in that action, seeking, among other things, to enforce the buyout  obligation. The action is scheduled to go to trial on October 17, 2022 for 15  days. [9]     On that basis, ADC says that Jeana has, at best, only questionable standing  as a creditor of Sandhurst to seek a bankruptcy order. It cites various  authorities for the proposition that in the absence of clear evidence that the  requisite preconditions for the order are satisfied, the application should be  refused. In particular, it has been held that where the underlying debt forming  the foundation for the order is disputed, the matter should go to trial, rather  than be resolved in bankruptcy court; see:  Inex Pharmaceuticals Corp. (Re) ,  2006 BCCA 108 at para. 19;  Aquasure Technologies Inc .  (Re) ,  [2008] 45 C.B.R. (5th) 300 at para. 6;  Bearcat Exploration Ltd .  (Re) ,  2003 ABCA 365, at para. 15. ADC also cites  Sather Ranch Ltd. (Re) , 2019  BCSC 677, as an example of a case in which the court refused to make a  bankruptcy order when the real dispute was seen to be between two shareholders  who were at loggerheads, rather than about a clearly insolvent enterprise  unable to satisfy its obligations as they came due. [10]     Jeana argues that ADC\u2019s authorities are distinguishable, insofar as they  all involved a  bona fide  dispute raised by the debtor, rather than a  shareholder, as to the existence or extent of the underlying debt asserted by  the applicant creditor. I pause to note that the facts in  Sather   Ranch   in particular are not so easily distinguished on that basis. There, the  validity and extent of the applicant shareholder\u2019s debt was, as here,  challenged by the other shareholder, rather than by the debtor company itself.  [11]     But I agree that  Sather Ranch  is distinguishable on other  grounds, insofar as the result in that case flowed partly from a finding that  the applicant shareholder was pursuing a bankruptcy \u201cas a tactical move \u2026 to  use the  BIA  to his advantage\u201d in the ongoing dispute between the  shareholders. The reason Jeana has given for seeking a bankruptcy order in this  case is to reverse priorities. In addition, the court in  Sather   Ranch   was unable on the evidence before it to discern the actual state of  accounts as between the parties, a controversy that was held to be more  properly dealt with in the related litigation.  [12]     Jeana relies on  0757376 B.C. Ltd. (Re) , 2011 BCSC 1268. In that  case, Burnyeat J. dismissed an appeal from a master\u2019s bankruptcy order. The  master had granted that order on the application of a shareholder and creditor,  relying on the debtor company\u2019s failure to repay the debt that it owed to him,  despite the fact that the extent of the indebtedness was disputed by another  shareholder. The result appears to have turned on the fact that the debtor  company had clearly failed in the previous six months to meet its obligations  as they became due and at least $1,000 was clearly owed to the petitioning  shareholder, even if the precise amount of the indebtedness was disputed.  [13]     In this case, what is in issue is not the state of the accounts between  the parties but rather whether the debt that is admittedly owing is properly  owed to Jeana or ADC.  [14]     Regardless of the outcome in the other litigation between the parties,  it is not seriously disputed that Jeana is presently owed the debt that it  asserts. In that regard, Jeana notes that the order of Coval J. made October 6,  2021 has directed that the net balance of the sale proceeds be paid to Jeana\u2019s  solicitors, in partial payment of the same debt that is asserted on this  application, or at least the secured portion of it. I agree that it would be  inconsistent for this court to refuse the relief sought on this application on  the basis that the unsecured portion of that same debt may not be owing to  Jeana after all.  [15]     The relief that ADC seeks in the related litigation includes an order  compelling Jeana to sell its shares and shareholder loan position to ADC  following the final disposition of the matter. ADC does not allege that such a  sale has already occurred or that Jeana has been holding its interest in the  loan in trust for ADC since October 20, 2020. There is no interim order in  place that restricts the exercise of Jeana\u2019s rights as creditor. [16]     Jeana\u2019s loan to Sandhurst was stated to be repayable on demand. On  November 16, 2021, Jeana demanded repayment. Sandhurst was unable to repay the  outstanding balance, given that its only significant asset had recently been  sold through a receivership, leaving a sizeable shortfall well in excess of  $1,000. [17]     In summary, I am satisfied that both elements of the test have been  satisfied and that there is no reason to refuse the relief sought. I am  therefore granting the application. [18]     As the successful party, Jeana is entitled to its costs. \u201cMilman  J.\u201d",

Vancouver Swing Society, 2020 BCCA 40 Date: 20200124 Docket: CA46012 Between: Mokua Gichuru Appellant (Petitioner) And Vancouver Swing Society, Matthew Lam, Kaitlin Russell, Angelena Weddell and The BC Human Rights Tribunal Respondents (Respondents) Before: The Honourable Madam Justice Saunders The Honourable Mr. Justice Fitch The Honourable Mr. Justice Butler On an application to vary: An order of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, dated October 25, 2019 ( Gichuru v. Vancouver Swing Society , Vancouver Docket CA46012). Oral Reasons for Judgment Appearing as agent for the Appellant: G. Kimani Counsel for the Respondents, Vancouver Swing Society, Matthew Lam, Kaitlin Russell and Angelena Weddell: G. Henry Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British Columbia January 24, 2020 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia January 24, 2020 Summary: The appellant\u2019s application to vary an order he post security for costs is allowed only to the extent of extending the time for doing so, and setting aside the order he pay costs of the application for security for costs in any event of the cause. Comment on denial of request to hear the application by telephone because the applicant is in a foreign jurisdiction. [1] SAUNDERS J.A. : By order of Madam Justice Dickson made October 25, 2019, the appellant, Mr. Gichuru, was ordered to post security for costs of his appeal in the amount of $7,000 by December 31, 2019, pending which the appeal is stayed, with liberty to the respondents to apply to dismiss the appeal in the event the monies are not posted in the time provided. [2] Mr. Gichuru applies to vary that order pursuant to s. 9(6) of the Court of Appeal Act , R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 77 . [3] As a preliminary matter, I will record that on Friday, January 17, 2020, we received a letter from Mr. Gichuru explaining (as he had to the single justice) that he is currently resident in Korea and unable to attend today. He asked that we hear him by telephone, and provided what he said was his telephone number in Korea. Mr. Gichuru made a similar request of the justice hearing the security for costs application in October. We declined that request, as had the justice hearing the application in October. Such a procedure is neither effective nor efficient, and erroneously puts the onus on the court in respect to matters outside our jurisdiction. Generally speaking, it is not a practice we would adopt. We did agree, however, that Mr. Gichuru could have an agent attend on his behalf today, and today Ms. Kimani helpfully attended and presented orally a statement authored by Mr. Gichuru. [4] With that explanation, I turn to the application before us. It is well established that an application to vary an order of a single justice is not a rehearing of the original application: the approach a division of the court will bring to the matter is highly deferential and it is not enough to allege that the justice erred in the exercise of discretion. The court may interfere with the order of a single justice if there has been an error in principle, the justice was wrong in the legal sense, the justice misconceived the facts, or relevant information was not brought to the justice\u2019s attention: DeFehr v. DeFehr , 2002 BCCA 139; Haldorson v. Coquitlam (City) , 2000 BCCA 672. [5] In this case, the application before the justice was for an order Mr. Gichuru post security for costs. That application fell to be decided on consideration of the four factors discussed by Mr. Justice Lowry in the case referred to by the justice, Creative Salmon Company Ltd. v. Staniford , 2007 BCCA 285: 1. the appellant\u2019s financial means; 2. the merits of the appeal; 3. the timeliness of the application; and 4. whether the costs will be readily recoverable. [6] In his application to vary, Mr. Gichuru does not say the justice recited the incorrect factors, but says instead that she erred in her assessment of those factors. In particular he contends the justice erred in: 1) failing to give pre-eminent weight to the respondents\u2019 tardiness in filing their application (I note that that complaint is strengthened and repeated today in the statement read by Ms. Kimani); 2) determining the appeal \u201clacks obvious merit\u201d; 3) referring to comments of Madam Justice Garson in Gichuru v. Pallai, 2018 BCCA 78, to the effect that he had paid numerous court fees in pursuing a series of actions over the past decade; 4) failing to limit the order to costs incurred after the date of the application, 5) establishing the deadline for posting the security; and 6) ordering costs in favour of the respondents in any event of the cause. [7] Mr. Gichuru also complains that he was denied an adjournment of the hearing in October 2019, and that the justice failed to accommodate the difficulties he was encountering in pursuing this matter while a resident of a foreign country. [8] In the statement read today, Mr. Gichuru referred us to the recent decision of a single justice, Jacques v. Muir , 2019 BCCA 456, in which Mr. Justice Groberman declined to order security for costs because the application was brought after filings were compete, saying: \u201cThis Court has generally refused late applications for security for costs.\u201d [9] Justice Dickson described the circumstances of the appeal and the application in this fashion: [3] The application concerns the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal\u2019s (\u201cHRT\u201d) refusal to accept a complaint of Mr. Gichuru\u2019s for filing. Mr. Gichuru unsuccessfully sought reconsideration of this decision and then judicial review. He now appeals the dismissal of his judicial review application (indexed at Gichuru v. Vancouver Swing Society , 2019 BCSC 402). [4] Mr. Gichuru complained that VSS discriminated against him on the basis of age, sex and race and, in particular, for being an older black male. The chambers judge summarized the dispute as follows: [11] ... the crux of Mr. Gichuru\u2019s complaint to the Tribunal involved what can be described as a dispute on Facebook over Mr. Gichuru\u2019s conduct related to other female members of the VSS. Mr. Gichuru felt as if he had been harassed on Facebook by female members of the VSS and raised the issue with Ms. Wendell and Mr. Lam. It is clear that Mr. Gichuru expected the VSS executive to take his side on the issue, but they did not. Ultimately, the VSS executive asked other members of the VSS for input on Mr. Gichuru\u2019s behavior and determined that it was his behavior that was problematic, although this was not known to Mr. Gichuru at the time. In response, Mr. Lam agreed to meet with Mr. Gichuru and provided him with three documents: a Facebook post written from the perspective of an older man in the swing community about older men crossing lines with younger women with romantic pursuits; a document on \u201cEmotional Labour\u201d, which included sections discussing \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d; and an article titled \u201cHow To Not Be Creepy\u201d, which Mr. Lam recognized as having an inflammatory title in his email. [5] On March 21, 2019, the judge held that the HRT had jurisdiction to screen the complaint and found the decisions in question were not patently unreasonable. [6] Mr. Gichuru filed a notice of appeal on April 11, 2019. Although he has not filed any affidavit material in response to the security for costs application, in his written submission filed yesterday he asserts that VSS indicated an intention to apply for an order for security for costs. However, they did not do so until September 23, 2019, when they brought this application. By that time, the materials for the appeal had already been filed by all parties. VSS offered no explanation for the delay. In his written submission, Mr. Gichuru asserts that he spent approximately 100 hours on the appeal between April 18, 2019 and September 23, 2019. [10] In my view, none of the submissions advanced by Mr. Gichuru provide a basis upon which we can or should interfere with the order for security for costs. I would give him some relief, however, on the deadline for posting the security for costs, and on the order for costs of the application. [11] I address first Mr. Gichuru\u2019s submissions concerning the court process. I have reviewed the file material carefully and see no basis for complaint. Mr. Gichuru has had the ability to communicate with this court electronically and has done so, and he has been accorded the opportunity to have an agent appear on his behalf, including today. Just as we have had the opportunity to review the file materials, so, too, the justice hearing the security for costs application had materials before her and referred to them in her decision. In particular, I would reject, as I have explained above, the proposition that Mr. Gichuru was entitled to the telephone attendances that he proposed. [12] I turn now to the criteria for the order that Mr. Gichuru seeks to vary, starting with the merits factor. Mr. Gichuru contends that the justice mis-assessed the merits of the appeal. He says that the reasons of the Human Rights Tribunal wrongly treated his complaint as one the Tribunal could decline to file, but it was not open to the Tribunal to decline to file a complaint after the 2002 amendments to the Human Rights Code , R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 210. He says Mr. Justice Masuhara erred when he found otherwise. [13] I see no error in the justice\u2019s assessment of the merits of the appeal. Justice Masuhara found that s. 27 of the Human Rights Code gave the Human Rights Tribunal jurisdiction to dismiss an appeal summarily and said, after reviewing the substance of the Tribunal\u2019s decision: \u201cthis is what happened here \u2026 the complaint did not allege an act or omission that contravened the Code \u201d. He referred to the language of the Tribunal\u2019s decision of refusing to file the complaint as an artifact of the previous legislation and said \u201cbut it is clear upon close evaluation of the statutory regime that the Tribunal had the authority to dismiss his complaint for the reasons given.\u201d That authority is found in s. 21, not s. 27. I see no real prospect that a division of this court would interfere with the substance of the conclusion that the Tribunal had the jurisdiction required to do as it did. In sum, I find no basis to interfere with the justice\u2019s conclusion that the appeal lacks obvious merit. [14] Nor do I see error in her evaluation of Mr. Gichuru\u2019s financial circumstances, or that the respondents, if successful on appeal, will be unlikely to readily recover costs that may be ordered in their favour. The justice observed that a search of Mr. Gichuru\u2019s history of initiating actions resulted in 84 reported judgments on CanLII. That level of court activity demonstrates that Mr. Gichuru has been able to pay numerous court fees in pursing actions over the years. The justice observed that she had no evidence before her that Mr. Gichuru would be unable to pursue his appeal were he required to post the security for costs. While he makes that submission, the submission is unsupported by the record. [15] On the other hand, there was evidence before the justice that Mr. Gichuru does not own real property in British Columbia and he is currently living in a foreign jurisdiction. Mr. Gichuru himself did not depose to having exigible assets in this jurisdiction, and he concedes in fact in his written argument at para. 48: 48. Nevertheless, and in the alternative, the application should have been rejected on the basis that although the respondents\u2019 chances of recovering their costs in the event they are successful on the appeal is doubtful , appellants who are without the financial ability to post security should not be precluded from pursuing a meritorious appeal for that reason alone. [Emphasis added.] [16] It was open to the justice to conclude that the respondents would have difficulty in recovering payment on an order in their favour for payment of costs of the appeal. One cannot say the justice erred in her application of the financial considerations. [17] All of this left the issue of the timeliness of the application which was, as the justice recognized, the only factor weighing against the respondents\u2019 application. While timeliness is, generally speaking, important, it is not an invariable rule that an application brought after all the necessary filings have been made will be denied. It is, in the end, always an exercise of discretion taking all the circumstances into account. What is required of the justice is consideration of the entire picture. I conclude the justice here based her decision that security for costs should be posted on the entire circumstances before her, as she was required to do. Although we are referred to Jacques , that case does not reflect the difficult financial circumstances of the respondent arising from this litigation noted by Justice Dickson in her para. 23 of the reasons for the order that is sought to be varied: [23] [Vancouver Swing Society] is a small non-profit society, its resources have been exhausted by this litigation, and its directors have had to pay out\u2011of-pocket to continue defending themselves in this litigation. This factor weighs further in favour of a security for costs order. [18] I see no basis upon which we can, properly, interfere with that decision. [19] Nor do I see a basis upon which to say the justice was required to limit the amount posted to costs going forward as Mr. Gichuru now proposes. While that was one alternative available to her, it was not presented to her, and she cannot be faulted for declining to reduce the amount sought to be posted as security. [20] This leaves the time established by the order for the posting of security for costs, and the order for costs of the application to the respondents. The justice directed that the security for costs be posted by December 31, 2019. That date has come and gone. This application to vary the order was filed within time, but the reasons of the justice were not available to Mr. Gichuru for some time and I cannot see how Mr. Gichuru could have had this application heard by a division by the deadline of December 31, 2019 in all the circumstances. I consider it is appropriate to allow Mr. Gichuru some further time to file the security for costs. I would extend the time for filing security for costs to February 28, 2020. [21] The final question is the order for costs of the application before the justice. The usual order is that costs are in the cause. While I consider the appeal to be one of dim merit, that result is not a total foregone conclusion. There is, in my view, no reason that the respondents should be entitled to costs of the application in the event Mr. Gichuru\u2019s appeal is successful. [22] I would allow the application to vary only to the limited extent of extending the time for Mr. Gichuru\u2019s compliance with the order to post security for costs to February 28, 2020, and setting aside the order for costs of the application before Justice Dickson in favour of the respondents. [23] FITCH J.A. : I agree. [24] BUTLER J.A. : I agree. [25] SAUNDERS J.A. : The application to vary is allowed to the extent the time for posting the security for costs is now February 28, 2020. The order made by Justice Dickson for costs of that application in favour of the respondents is set aside. \u201cThe Honourable Madam Justice Saunders\u201d",

        "text": "IN THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA Citation: Dunn v. Heise, 2021 BCSC 1209 Date: 20210108 Docket: M184390 Registry: Vancouver Between: Nicolas Dunn and Her Majesty The Queen In Right Of Alberta Plaintiffs And Ernest Alan Heise, Add Capital Corp., Legendery Holdings Inc., National Leasing Group Inc., and Hope Truck & Trailer Repair Ltd. Defendants Before: The Honourable Madam Justice Matthews Oral Reasons for Judgment \u2013 Evidence of Dr. Rose Counsel for the Plaintiff Nicolas Dunn: G. Battista, Q.C. A. Paladeau Counsel for the Defendants: C.R. Fister K.A. Buecker Place and Dates of Trial/Hearing: Vancouver, B.C. January 4-6, 2021 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, B.C. January 8, 2021 [1] During this trial for damages arising from a motor vehicle accident, the plaintiff seeks to have his treating psychologist, Dr. Kris Rose, testify. The plaintiff has not served an expert report in accordance with the Supreme Court Civil Rules . The plaintiff has provided a will-say statement, which outlines the evidence that Dr. Rose is expected to give. [2] The defendants, Ernest Heise, Add Capital Corp., and Legendery Holdings Inc., object to portions of the anticipated evidence of Dr. Rose on the basis that it is expert evidence for which no notice nor report in accordance with the Rules has been delivered. The defendants National Leasing Group Inc. and Hope Truck & Trailer Repair Ltd. are not participating in this trial. [3] It is common in claims for damages arising from personal injury for treating physicians to testify as to the plaintiff's attendance for medical care, diagnosis, and treatment. In summary, the evidence that the plaintiff sought treatment and that the treating physician made certain observations, diagnoses, and treatment recommendations is evidence of facts that the physician personally observed in his or her assessments of the plaintiff and the plaintiff's medical status before treatment, during treatment, and up to the time the physician testifies. This evidence is not admissible as opinion evidence for the truth of the physician\u2019s observations, diagnosis, or assessment before and during treatment. Rather, such evidence is admissible for the truth that the plaintiff attended on that physician and that the physician made certain observations, diagnoses, and treatment recommendations: Edmondson v. Payer , 2011 BCSC 118; Firman v. Asadi , 2018 BCSC 2437; Anderson v. Dwyer , 2009 BCSC 1872; Cambie Surgeries Corporation v. British Columbia (Medical Services Commission) , 2016 BCSC 1390 at para. 22; Cambie Surgeries Corporation v. British Columbia (Attorney General) , 2016 BCSC 2161 at para. 46; and Cambie Surgeries Corporation v. British Columbia (Attorney General) , 2018 BCSC 514 at paras. 35, 36, and 39. [4] This approach is equally applicable to health care providers who are not physicians and can include evidence that might be characterized as opinion evidence from a person with expertise. For example, in Anderson , a chiropractor was permitted to testify as to the anatomical features he observed on X-rays. The chiropractor's interpretation of the X-rays was informed by his training and expertise. Mr. Justice Schultes characterized the observation as fact, not an opinion, even though the chiropractor was seeing facts that may be invisible to a person who did not have his training. [5] The defendants brought Welch v. Tietge , 2017 BCSC 395 to my attention. In that decision, Mr. Justice Johnston said that treating physicians who are called without the plaintiff serving opinions that satisfy Rules 11-6 and 11-7 are confined to giving evidence of date on which the doctor saw the patient, any tests or examinations conducted, and any prescriptions or recommendations given. They are not permitted to stray into areas of opinion, such as what the doctor concluded as a result of tests or examinations conducted or what the doctor's opinion was as to the probable efficacy of any prescriptions or recommendations given to the plaintiff (at para. 59). [6] However, Johnston J.\u2019s statement in Welch was not made in the context of discussing whether such evidence was admissible and for what purpose, but rather in the context of deciding whether to draw an adverse inference from the failure to call such evidence. In that regard, it is obiter when it is considered in a case where the issue is admissibility. It is inconsistent with the weight of authority on admissibility as I have described. [7] The law pertaining to the evidence of health care professionals testifying as to facts overlaps with the body of law pertaining to so called \u201clay opinion evidence\u201d. The seminal case on lay opinion evidence is Graat v. The Queen , [1982] 2 S.C.R. 819. In McKnight v. Bourque , 2018 BCSC 1342 at para. 53, Madam Justice DeWitt-Van Oosten, then of this court, described lay opinion evidence as evidence of \u201can impression formed or inference drawn by a witness in a non-specialized area, based on personal observations or information gathered by that individual,\u201d where the impression or inference is conveyed to the fact finder in the form of an opinion. Madam Justice DeWitt-Van Oosten cited Graat for that proposition. She noted that the opinion sometimes takes into account the witness\u2019s practical experience. She gave what she termed classic examples of lay opinion evidence, such as the police officer who expresses an opinion of a person\u2019s level of impairment by alcohol based on observable symptoms of intoxication or who provides an estimate of the speed of a vehicle. [8] I agree with counsel for the defendants that there is a continuum of lay opinion evidence. At some point, it is not admissible unless it is the subject of an expert report prepared by a person with appropriate qualifications and delivered in accordance with the Rules . In Anderson , Mr. Justice Schultes said the distinguishing line is between evidence of facts that someone with special training perceives versus subjective judgment applied to those facts. The latter is not admissible unless it is the subject of an expert report in compliance with the Rules . [9] For example, in Cannon v. Al Perrett Enterprises Inc. , 2018 BCSC 337, Madam Justice Donegan permitted the evidence of a police officer who attended the scene of the accident after the accident had occurred and prepared an investigative report that was not prepared for the purpose of the litigation or served in the litigation. Madam Justice Donegan permitted the police officer to testify as to what he observed, including his estimate of the length of skid-marks of one of the vehicles involved in the accident and the origin of rubber and scrape marks he observed at the site of the accident. However, she did not permit him to testify as to the cause of the skid-marks, the motorcycle speed at the time of the crash, or the cause of the crash itself. She characterized the evidence as opinion evidence for which an expert must be properly qualified to offer the opinion and his or her evidence must be relevant and not subject to any exclusionary rule. Madam Justice Donegan cited the law pertaining to lay opinion evidence but found that the police officer's opinions went beyond what the police officer saw and did and went to the principal issue in the case. In addition, because the opinions went beyond matters of everyday inferences from observed facts and there was no evidence of the police officer's experiential capacity to form the opinion, those opinions were classic expert opinions for which a report must be delivered from an expert who is qualified to give such opinions at trial. [10] It is apparent that evidence that could be characterized as opinion evidence may be admissible as fact evidence (e.g., evidence of a diagnosis tendered for the fact that the diagnosis was made, not that the diagnosis was correct) or as fact evidence by someone who, by virtue of training or experience, can perceive things that others cannot see. At the same time, it is apparent that in some cases such evidence is not admissible unless the rules pertaining to expert reports have been complied with or the court gives leave to dispense with the rules regarding expert evidence. The issue in this case is where the line is between admissibility and inadmissibility and the application of that to the facts of this case. [11] In my view, the authorities demonstrate that the location of the line depends on the facts of the case, the nature of the evidence, and the purpose for which the evidence is being tendered. If it is only tendered for the fact that the opinion was reached, it is usually admissible. Where the facts on which the opinion is based are not relevant in and of themselves and it is really the opinion that is relevant, or where the opinion is central to the case and requires subjective judgment to reach, it is not admissible because it is an impermissible circumvention of the expert evidence rules. Similarly, if the person giving the evidence did not personally observe the events that she or she is interpreting, then it is classic expert evidence that is hearsay and must comply with the rules pertaining to expert evidence reports in order for it to be admissible. [12] With these principles in mind, I turn to the will-say statement of Dr. Rose. The will-say statement is three pages in length and consists of paragraphs under headings. [13] I preface my discussion of the will-say statement by saying that in my view, most of it falls into the category of permissible evidence from a treating health care professional. The bulk of the will-say statement refers to Mr. Dunn\u2019s visits to Dr. Rose, Dr. Rose\u2019s observations of Mr. Dunn, his diagnosis of Mr. Dunn, his treatment of Mr. Dunn, and his observations regarding Mr. Dunn\u2019s progress. [14] I note that the latter issue, the progress he observed, is a matter that includes opinion evidence, as is the evidence pertaining to diagnosis. Evidence of diagnosis and progress, as well as the characterization of some of the observations made by Dr. Rose are admissible for the fact that he observed those things, made the diagnosis, and concluded certain things about progress. They are not evidence of the truth of the opinions that they contain. [15] I will address the portions of the will-say statement that the defendants made specific submissions to by paragraph. The paragraphs are not numbered, so for the purpose of referring to them in these reasons, I have numbered them with paragraph number 1 being the paragraph immediately under the heading \"Background\" and starting \"he is a duly registered psychologist.\" The will-say statement ends at paragraph 21 on page 3 at the second paragraph under the heading \"Current Treatment.\" That paragraph begins \u201cto date he has provided over 80 sessions of therapy.\u201d [16] Paragraph 5 of the will-say statement reads as follows: He observed Mr. Dunn become repeatedly startled by unexpected motion in the interview room. He observed Mr. Dunn flinch when he made sudden movements with his own arm during discussions. Mr. Dunn appeared anxious. Mr. Dunn was emotionally fragile, which was consistent with his experience interviewing other patients in a clinical setting who were diagnosed with posttraumatic stress. The severity of Mr. Dunn's PTSD symptoms were comparable to the more severe cases of PTSD in police and military members, some of whom have been rendered unemployable by those symptoms. [17] In my view, the first three sentences of paragraph 5 describe evidence of Dr. Rose\u2019s observations of Mr. Dunn, which do not stray into the area of technical observations for which expertise is required. The fourth sentence commencing \u201cMr. Dunn was emotionally fragile\u201d may arguably require special training or have been the subject of the application of Dr. Rose's special training, but it is consistent with the type of lay opinion evidence permitted from persons with special training to draw inferences from facts that other persons may not be able to draw: Anderson . [18] Continuing with paragraph 5 of the will-say statement, I am of the view that the anticipated evidence in the last sentence in that paragraph, which commences with \u201cthe severity of Mr. Dunn's PTSD symptoms\u201d, strays into the area of evidence that is inadmissible because it is the opinion of the type that notice ought to have been given in compliance with the Rules . In that sentence of the will-say statement, the plaintiff anticipates that Dr. Rose will testify about the plaintiff\u2019s symptoms as compared to those of persons in certain categories. I assume by the description that Dr. Rose will refer to persons who have experienced extremely traumatic events. This observation and opinion made by Dr. Rose is one that relies on his observations outside of the observations he made of Mr. Dunn, i.e. , his observations and experience in treating police and military members, and so relies on facts not in evidence in this trial. It also relies on a level of expertise that is beyond that of permissible \u201clay opinion evidence\u201d given by a person with special training or experience. It is a type of expert opinion evidence that is hearsay and it is the application of subjective judgment to draw inferences from facts. It is not admissible. [19] The next paragraph over which there is an issue is at paragraph 7, which reads as follows: He administered six separate tests to Mr. Dunn. Mr. Dunn easily fulfilled the criteria from the DSM-V for chronic post-traumatic stress disorder. Mr. Dunn has PTSD and related symptoms across all realms with symptoms in the severe to extreme ranges. He noted individual scale scores measuring intrusion of experience, avoidance, depression, and suicidal ideation, for in the 99th percentile, and his impression was that these were specific areas of concern for Mr. Dunn. [20] The defendant objects to all of the anticipated evidence except that described in the first sentence of paragraph 7. I conclude that the evidence described in the first and second sentences is admissible as evidence of Dr. Rose\u2019s observations and conclusions he reached based on his assessment of Mr. Dunn. In the second sentence the word \u201ceasily\u201d is inappropriate for lay opinion evidence and should not form part of Dr. Rose\u2019s evidence. The evidence described in the third sentence is partly admissible and partly inadmissible. The part that is inadmissible is the part that reads \u201cwith symptoms in the severe to extreme ranges.\u201d This anticipated evidence is subjective and requires Dr. Rose to apply his judgment as a psychologist to form a comparative opinion. In addition, it appears to call upon facts that are not in evidence in this case. It is not admissible for the purpose that Dr. Rose reached this conclusion during his treatment of Mr. Dunn, as there is no relevance to this comparison. The evidence is only relevant if the opinion is true. [21] The fourth sentence of paragraph 7 records Dr. Rose's observations from his testing. It is relevant and so it is admissible for the fact that he recorded that observation, not that it was a correct observation. [22] Paragraph 8 reads as follows: Mr. Dunn was someone suffering from marked distress and was severely impaired. Mr. Dunn's extreme distress put him at a high risk for suicide. Mr. Dunn reported drinking four or five beers per night to cope with his suffering. The drinking was new since the accident. [23] The defendant objects to the first and second sentences of this paragraph. In my view, this paragraph records Dr. Rose's observations and conclusions he reached. Those observations and conclusions are admissible for the fact that he made those observations and reached those conclusions in the course of his assessment and treatment of Mr. Dunn. They are not admissible for the truth of them. [24] The defendant objects to the evidence described in paragraph 9, which reads as follows: At that point, it was highly unlikely that Mr. Dunn would see a gradual abatement of his severe traumatic stress symptoms over time. He identified a variety of complicating variables, including: \u2022 Mr. Dunn's incomplete fragmented recollection of his traumatic experience; \u2022 an atypical event exposure involving multiple and potentially compounding moments of thinking that he would die or be severely injured; \u2022 the possibility that emotional responding to the event have been suppressed or avoided; \u2022 ongoing physical pain scarring and other related physical reminds [ sic ] serving as inescapable reminders of the accident; and \u2022 continuing problematic beliefs and vigilant behaviours. [25] In my view, this anticipated evidence, like paragraph 8, is about Dr. Rose's conclusions that assisted with his diagnosis and treatment plan for Mr. Dunn. The evidence is admissible for the fact that Dr. Rose reached those conclusions for those reasons, which then formed the basis of his recommended treatment plan. Again, they are admissible as facts of the conclusions that Dr. Rose reached and not for the truth of the conclusions. [26] The defendants object to the evidence described in paragraph 13, which reads as follows: Mr. Dunn's fragmented memories of the accident were continuing to be a complicating factor in his recovery. Mr. Dunn's tendency to dissociate was limiting his processing of emotional reactivity linked to the accident. [27] I am of the view that although this evidence appears to be an opinion that may call for subjective conclusions in the application of judgment, it is admissible to demonstrate the factors that played into Dr. Rose's continuing treatment and the treatment length of Mr. Dunn. Again, the evidence is not admissible for the truth of the conclusions he reached, but merely that he reached those conclusions and that played a role in Mr. Dunn's treatment. [28] The defendants object to the anticipated evidence set out in paragraph 16 of the will-say statement, which reads as follows: He noted improvement in Mr. Dunn. By May 2019 [ sic ] was that Mr. Dunn still had a diagnosis of PTSD but it was an early partial remission. Mr. Dunn was still vulnerable to triggering events. He identified that Mr. Dunn was continuing to experience residual symptoms of PTSD, including obsessive-compulsive behaviour and hyperarousal symptoms (irritability, anger, sleep impairment, memory, concentration, and attention failures, exaggerated startle response, panic and hypervigilance). He also noted episodic driving-related anxiety. [29] With regard to the first two sentences, the defendants put those portions of Dr. Rose\u2019s records to the plaintiff in cross-examination as to the duration and severity of the plaintiff's emotional status. They object to the rest of the paragraph. That objection is not consonant with their reliance on the first two sentences because those sentences are no different from the rest of the paragraph. They are Dr. Rose's observations at points in time and a description of his observations of Mr. Dunn at those points in time. The evidence in that paragraph is admissible for the fact that Dr. Rose drew those conclusions and made those observations at the respective points in time. [30] The defendants also object to portions of paragraphs 19 and 20. In my view, the anticipated evidence in the portions of those paragraphs to which the defendants object falls into the same category as paragraph 16 and is admissible on the same basis. [31] Dr. Rose may testify in accordance with these reasons. \u201cMatthews J.\u201d",

        "text": "IN THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA Citation: Dosanjh v. Johal, 2021 BCSC 150 Date: 20210111 Docket: M140866 Registry: Vancouver Between: Jasmeen Kaur Dosanjh Plaintiff And Harman Johal, Davinder Johal, Inderjit Jammu and Bhupinder Sandhu Defendants And Insurance Corporation of British Columbia Third Party And: Docket: M156884 Registry: Vancouver Between: Jasmeen Kaur Dosanjh Plaintiff And Sandip Natasha Samra Defendant Before: The Honourable Madam Justice Matthews (Appearance via telephone) Oral Reasons for Judgment In Chambers Counsel for Jasmeen Kaur Dosanjh appearing by teleconference: D. Miura Counsel for the Third Party Insurance Corporation of British Columbia appearing by teleconference: C.G. Kelly Counsel for Natasha Samra appearing by teleconference: R.W. Richardson No other appearances Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, B.C. January 11, 2021 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, B.C. January 11, 2021 [1] These two actions rise out of a motor vehicle accident that occurred on October 12, 2013, in which Jasmeen Kaur Dosanjh was a passenger in a vehicle driven by the defendant, Sandeep Natasha Samra. During a police chase, a vehicle driven by the defendant Harman Johal and owned by the defendant Davinder Johal ran a red light and struck a vehicle driven by Inderjit Jammu which then struck the Samra vehicle. The Samra vehicle and a vehicle driven by the defendant Bhupinder Sandhu also collided. Ms. Dosanjh's injuries are significant. Her claim has been valued by the Third Party, the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia. It is likely that all of the claims arising from this accident against the third party insurance available will exceed the amount of insurance. Ms. Dosanjh has underinsured motorist protection, but under the terms of that policy, that first party insurance is not available until she has exhausted her claim against the third party insurance. ICBC is prepared to waive its right that she exhaust her claims so long as certain declarations are made. [2] Accordingly, Ms. Dosanjh and ICBC seek a declaration that ICBC may pay advances to Ms. Dosanjh from her underinsured motorist protection and the advances paid will not extend the limits of the third party liability insurance of the Johal defendants. As well, they seek a declaration that all claimants, including Ms. Dosanjh, will remain entitled to their pro rata share of the insurance limit once all claims have been valued with the individual uninsured motorist protection issues to be dealt with following that sharing. Finally, they seek certain ancillary orders including costs. [3] I gave these reasons orally. I have edited them without changing the substance. [4] The orders are sought in both actions. They are as follows: 1. The Plaintiff, Jasmeen Kaur Dosanjh, and the Third Party seek the following declarations: a) The Third Party can pay to Jasmeen Dosanjh advance payments from her Underinsured Motorist Protection policy pursuant to Part 10 of the Insurance (Motor Vehicle) Act , BC Reg 447/83; b) Any and all advances paid will not extend the Johal Defendants insurance limits of $2,000,000 under the policy issued by the Third Party to them (the \u201cInsurance Limits\u201d); c) All claimants, including the Plaintiff, will remain entitled to their pro rata share of the Insurance Limits once all claims have been valued, with the individual Underinsured Motorist Protection issues to be dealt with following that sharing; d) In the event that a claimant having a potential insurance third party claim against the Third Party dies or has a change in legal status prior to the time that all the Other Claimant\u2019s claims against the Third Party are resolved, this declaration will have no effect on the legal consequence that would otherwise flow from the change; and e) The parties and respondents affected by this Declaration shall have leave to apply for further directions. 2. The parties each bear their own costs. [5] Based on the submissions of counsel, I am satisfied that all persons who ought to have notice and could be served have been served or given notice. I was advised that counsel believe that the claims of the driver of one of the vehicles that the Samra vehicle collided with, Bhupinder Sandhu, have been settled. Counsel for another claimant, Ms. Samra, is attending this application. Counsel for the plaintiff, Ms. Dosanjh, is also counsel for another claimant and so has notice of this application through counsel. In addition, notice has been given to a potential claimant, Mr. Jammu, of these applications. The Johal defendants have been breached by their insurance carrier and have not been reachable. [6] There are multiple claims arising out of this accident. In addition to Ms. Dosanjh\u2019s claims, the driver of the vehicle in which Ms. Dosanjh was a passenger, Ms. Samra, has brought a claim. The other passenger in the Samra vehicle has brought a claim. Mr. Sandhu brought a claim. Mr. Jammu has brought a claim. One claim has a trial date in 2022 and the other two claims do not yet have trial dates. I have been advised that attempts have been made to resolve all the claims, but not successfully. [7] In this application, the ICBC as third party, supported by Ms. Dosanjh, applies to address the fact that Ms. Dosanjh\u2019s claims for her serious injuries involve a third party insurance coverage which must be shared pro rata between the claims of all persons who advance them successfully. That pro rata determination, obviously, cannot be made until the conclusion of those claims by either trial or settlement. [8] Ms. Dosanjh has underinsured motorist protection in the amount of $2,000,000. ICBC is prepared to provide her compensation through that prior to the pro rata distribution of the third party insurance proceeds despite that the applicable policy requires Ms. Dosanjh to exhaust all other remedies which, in this case, would include her claim against the third party insurance. [9] The declarations sought are to protect ICBC from which protect ICBC from paying out more than it would be required to pay out if the usual steps in the policy required sequence are undertaken. [10] The declarations sought will address the fact that Ms. Dosanjh's serious injuries have resulted in a significant claim which has been valued but cannot be paid out. It is now seven years after the accident. The other claims will not be resolved in the foreseeable future. That leaves Ms. Dosanjh in a position where her claim is resolved or resolvable, but she cannot receive her compensation because her pro rata entitlement to the third party limit cannot be ascertained and her right to be compensated under her underinsured motorist protection are not available until she has exhausted her claim against the third party insurance. [11] This type of situation was addressed by Mr. Justice Betton in Clark v. Bullock , 2013 BCSC 164. The substance of the application was almost identical to this one, although the circumstances were slightly different in that the potential claimants included infants and therefore a very long limitation period before all the claims could be known and quantified. [12] Mr. Justice Betton set out the essential issues and his reasons for granting the declarations sought as follows: [23] In this particular case, ICBC determined that it would waive the entitlement that it has by virtue of the legislation to require that Mr. Clark exhaust all of his remedies, including awaiting the payment of his pro rata entitlement to the $5,000,000 coverage under the Bullock policy; that is, ICBC would waive its entitlement to insist on all of those steps being taken before accessing the underinsured motorist protection coverage. [24] The condition it attaches is that it requires a declaration from court that would protect it against the potential for having to pay out more than the amount of the Bullock policy. [25] With that concession or that position being adopted by ICBC, these parties come before me with a request for a declaration. That declaration essentially allows ICBC to access the underinsured motorist protection coverage available to Mr. Clark to pay the amount that Justice Barrow has determined Mr. Clark is entitled to with adjustments as agreed to by the parties. [26] This would effectively be an interim measure pending the determination of the other claims and, with that, the ability to determine Mr. Clark's pro rata entitlement to the $5,000,000 in coverage. At that stage, any of the appropriate adjustments would be made to make Mr. Clark whole, as it were, and to pay out, on a pro rata basis, other plaintiffs arising from the incident. [27] Of concern in any type of arrangement or declaration such as this is whether there is any risk to those other claimants that they would have their pro rata entitlement adversely affected by such an order. [28] Given the nature of the declaration which is sought here, I am satisfied that that risk is addressed. The arrangement that is proposed here would insure that each of those plaintiffs would have full entitlement to their pro rata share of that $5,000,000 in coverage. [13] I agree with Mr. Justice Betton's reasoning and adopt it in this case. The circumstances are substantively identical and the proposed settlement and declarations sought will resolve a problem without negatively affecting the rights of any of the other claimants or defendants. [14] Accordingly, the application is granted in the form set out in the notice of application, paragraphs 1(a) through (e) and paragraph 2 of both notices of application. [15] Anything arising, counsel? [16] [Discussion between counsel and the Court] [17] Thank you, counsel, for your comprehensive material and helpful submissions. \u201cMatthews J.\u201d",

Defendants Before: The Honourable Madam Justice Choi Oral Reasons for Judgment In Chambers Counsel for the Plaintiff: P. Venegas G. Canniff Counsel for the Defendants: R. Raymond R. Mohan Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, B.C. January 6-7, 2020 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, B.C. January 7, 2020 [1] THE COURT: This is a damages\u2011only personal injury action arising from a motor vehicle accident. Liability has been admitted by the defendants. The trial was set for 10 days to commence on January 6, 2020. The plaintiff applies for an order prohibiting the defendants from calling five witnesses, and to exclude any new witnesses except by court order. The plaintiff argues that the proposed witnesses were either not on a witness list by the ordered deadline, or their \"will say\" statements were not provided by the order deadline. Counsel attended a trial management conference (TMC) on November 29, 2019, at which Justice Masuhara set a defence deadline for \"will say\" statements and contact information for the witnesses of three weeks prior to the trial, being December 16, 2019, and for an exchange of trial schedules of two weeks before the trial, being December 23, 2019. [2] The plaintiff also applies to prohibit the defendants from tendering two documents into evidence because they were not produced on any lists of documents until the day before trial. There were no TMC orders respecting the deadline for production of documents from the defendants. An order was made at the TMC that the plaintiff's updated list of documents must be provided two weeks before the trial; there was no similar order made pertaining to the defendants. [3] The defendants ultimately provided a witness list on December 16, followed by updates to the list and evolving \u201cwill say\u201d statements. The proposed defence witnesses at issue are as follows: 1) Derek Gulkison, the former spouse of the plaintiff and father to their child. He was on a witness list provided on December 16, 2019, but his \"will say\" statement was provided on December 30, 2019, and then expanded on January 2, 2020. 2) Judith Pinto, a director of human resources at a former employer for the plaintiff. She was on a witness list of December 23, 2019, with a \"will say\" statement provided on December 30, 2019. 3) Allison Spicer, the head of human resources of an employer where the plaintiff worked after the accident. She was on a witness list of December 23, 2019, but no \"will say\" statement has been provided. 4) Verna Ursula was on a witness list of December 16, 2019, but no \"will say\" statement has been provided. The defendants no longer intend to call Ms. Ursula as a witness. 5) Barry Wells, the CEO of an employer. He was on the defendants\u2019 December 16, 2019 witness list, and his \"will say\" statement was provided on January 2, 2020. [4] The defendants plan to call these witnesses mainly as rebuttal witnesses depending on the plaintiff's direct testimony. The two documents in question consist of a Provincial Court order dated December 14, 2017, respecting parenting arrangements in the plaintiff's family law case and a document titled \"places mom and Parker have slept and/or lived.\" Both were produced on the day before trial, i.e. , on Sunday, January 5, 2020, at 2:40 p.m. The defence counsel's communications noted that she only received the new documents the day prior, that being Saturday, January 4, 2020. [5] The plaintiff has provided three cases in support of her argument that I should not exercise my discretion to belatedly admit the evidence: Owens v. Steveston Waterfront Properties Inc. , 2019 BCSC 747; Tompkins v. Bruce (14 December 2011), Vancouver M070137 (B.C.S.C.); and Stone v. Ellerman , 2009 BCCA 294 at paras. 30\u201331. The defendants rely on Devathasan v. Devathasan , 2019 BCSC 1559; Davies v. Canada Shineray Suppliers Group Inc. , 2017 BCSC 304; Fu v. Zhu , 2017 BCSC 749; and Houston v. Kine , 2011 BCCA 358. Each of these cases sets out some basic factors the court might consider in exercising this discretionary power. These factors include whether: 1) there is prejudice to the other party; 2) there is a reasonable explanation for the delay; 3) the evidence is needed for a determination on the merits; and 4) the ends of justice require the evidence. [6] The defendants oppose the exclusion of the witnesses and documents on the basis that: 1) there will be serious prejudice since the plaintiff's evidence will be largely unchallenged because these are all the defendants\u2019 lay witnesses; 2) the delay was caused because the instructing client did not authorize work to mobilize witnesses until close to the commencement of the trial and only after mediation was unsuccessful; 3) the defence evidence is required for a determination on the merits, if the plaintiff\u2019s testimony is contrary to the information gathered; and 4) the ends of justice require a determination on the merits with all available evidence. [7] The plaintiff argues that the instructing defence policy should not be at her expense. The plaintiff is prejudiced if the trial proceeds with the last-minute inclusion of these witnesses because counsel will not have the chance to prepare, including searching for other witnesses that may contradict the defence witnesses. The plaintiff seeks an adjournment of the trial if the court will not grant the order to exclude the witnesses and documents. [8] For the reasons that follow, I adjourn the trial with costs thrown away payable forthwith to the plaintiff: 1) I am concerned that excluding the evidence might prevent the determination of the issues on the merits. Given the submissions, I anticipate the potential for serious conflicts in the evidence and for challenges to the plaintiff's credibility. Without the ability to rely on evidence from other witnesses and to use the said documents, there is a real risk the court will be hampered in its ability to determine the issues. 2) The proposed evidence may be important to the fact\u2011finding process. 3) I accept the plaintiff's argument that she will be prejudiced if the witnesses are allowed to testify at this time because she will not have time to adequately prepare. 4) The plaintiff is prejudiced by an adjournment as well, however, due to the time wasted in preparing for a second trial and by being delayed in an adjudication of her case. For this reason, I am awarding her costs thrown away, payable forthwith. 5) The defendants chose only to commence witness preparation at the last minute, only days before the TMC order deadline. This is a practice that deserves sanction and rebuke. Trial management conferences, the orders made there, and the deadlines set out in the Supreme Court Civil Rules are all designed to provide parties with time to prepare and to consider the strengths and weaknesses of their case, so a trial can proceed in an efficient manner. \u201cChoi J.\u201d",

        "text": "IN THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA Citation: Dais v. Virvilis , 2020 BCSC 35 Date: 20200114 Docket: S168555 Registry: Vancouver Between: Helen Dais Petitioner And Peter Virvilis, Dennis Virvilis, John Virvilis, Virvilis Holdings Ltd., PHD Properties Ltd., Belesarius Holdings Ltd., Broadway Towers Holdings Ltd., 537699 B.C. Ltd., Walnut Gate BT Holding Limited, PHD Property Management Ltd., and PHD Terwillegar Park Ltd. Respondents Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice Marchand Reasons for Judgment Counsel for the Petitioner: S.T.C. Warnett M. Maniago Counsel for the Respondents, Peter Virvilis and Dennis Virvilis: P.A. Spencer, Q.C. J.R. Facchin Counsel for the Respondents, John Virvilis and Virvilis Holdings Ltd. J.A. Rost A. Girou Place and Date of Trial: Vancouver, B.C. December 17, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, B.C. January 14, 2020 [1] John Virvilis is a self-made man. He has been an excellent provider for his wife, Tassia Virvilis, and his children, Peter Virvilis, Helen Dais and Dennis Virvilis. [2] To distinguish various family members from one another, I will refer to them by their first names. In doing so, I intend no disrespect. [3] Sadly, conflict within the Virvilis family has resulted in protracted litigation. By way of written reasons for judgment released on March 21, 2018, I made a number of orders requiring that Helen be bought out of various family companies. My earlier reasons for judgment are indexed at 2018 BCSC 459. Though Peter and Dennis have a significant interest in the outcome, the current application relates only to a dispute between Helen on the one hand and John, Virvilis Holdings Ltd. (\u201cVirvilis Holdings\u201d) and Broadway Towers Holdings Ltd. (\u201cBroadway Towers\u201d) on the other. [4] During the initial hearing of Helen\u2019s petition in 2018, the parties adduced extensive evidence about their family history as well as their ownership of various corporate entities, their varied contributions to the acquisition and operation of those entities, and the conflict that had resulted in irreconcilable differences between Helen and other family members in the operation of those entities. They did not provide any evidence regarding the value of their shareholdings. [5] On the evidence before me, I found that it was just and equitable to dissolve and liquidate the companies under s. 324(1)(b) of the Business Corporations Act , S.B.C. 2002, c. 57 [ BCA ]. Having made that finding, all of the so-called \u201coppression remedies\u201d under s. 227(3) of the BCA were available to me. [6] None of the parties wanted the family companies to be dissolved and liquidated. Rather, they sought to have Helen removed by different means. With respect to Broadway Towers, I concluded that it was most appropriate to make the following orders: \u2026 4. Broadway Towers, or its nominee, is ordered to purchase Helen\u2019s shares in Broadway Towers at their fair market value determined as of the date of this order by an independent business valuator who is satisfactory to each of Helen and John discounted by 40%. The terms of payment are to be determined by Helen and John. 5. In the event of disagreement between Helen and John regarding the valuation of Broadway Towers or terms of payment, each has leave to apply for directions. \u2026 [7] Helen and John were able to agree on a business valuator, Greg Williamson of Williamson Valuation and Litigation Support Ltd. They were unable to agree on the appropriate method to determine the fair market value of Helen\u2019s shares in Broadway Towers or payment terms. They seek direction. [8] Helen and John also ask that I address the costs of the previous application. [9] Helen seeks to have her shares in Broadway Towers valued using a market value approach based on the highest and best use of the commercial property owned by Broadway Towers with no additional minority or marketability discount applied. Based on Mr. Williamson\u2019s work and an application of the 40% discount I ordered, this would result in Helen receiving $6,041,734 for her shares. [10] John seeks to have Helen\u2019s shares valued at $2,000,000, which is all that he says Broadway Towers can afford without unduly disrupting his and Tassia\u2019s retirement income from Broadway Towers. This amount is based roughly on the value of Helen\u2019s shares in Broadway Towers using an income approach after applying the 40% discount I ordered, with no additional minority or marketability discount applied. In the alternative, if a market value approach is used, John submits that minority and marketability discounts ought to be applied on top of the 40% discount I ordered. [11] Regarding costs, as half of the previous application related to Helen\u2019s dispute with her father and half related to her dispute with her brothers, she seeks one-half of her costs against her father and Virvilis Holdings. She has resolved the issue of costs in relation to her dispute with her brothers directly with them. [12] John submits that success was divided and that he and Helen should therefore bear their own costs in relation to the previous application. He notes that Helen withdrew her oppression and unfair prejudice claims against him at the last minute and that she sought the fair market value of her shares with no discount applied. [13] The relevant background is set out in some detail in my earlier reasons for judgment. In these reasons, I will simply summarize the most salient points. [14] John emigrated from Greece to Canada in 1954 with nothing more than his work ethic and business acumen. He married Tassia in 1960. Peter was born in 1961, Helen in 1963 and Dennis in 1968. John is 91. Tassia is 81. [15] John has been very successful in business. Relatively soon after arriving in Canada, he opened a restaurant in Vancouver. As a result of the success of the restaurant, he incorporated a company which became Broadway Towers. In the 1970s and 1980s, Broadway Towers owned a number of apartment buildings. In the 1980s, Broadway Towers sold the last of these buildings and purchased a retail centre, Lougheed Village, in Coquitlam. [16] In 2004, John and Tassia effected an \u201cestate freeze\u201d in connection with Broadway Towers for estate planning purposes. As a result, on January 30, 2004, John and Tassia\u2019s shares in the company were sold to the company in exchange for new Class D preferred non-voting redeemable shares. The Class D shares were valued at $2,292,000, which reflected the value of Lougheed Village at that time. John was issued 49 Class A voting shares and Tassia was issued one Class A voting share. Each of Peter, Helen and Dennis were issued 100 Class B common non-voting shares valued at $0.01 each. [17] In 2014, the preferred Class D voting shares of Broadway Towers were transferred to Virvilis Holdings, a company which is controlled by John. Currently, John is the sole director of Broadway Towers. [18] The parties focussed much of their submissions on what I had \u201cobviously\u201d intended in my previous reasons for judgment. The trouble is that the parties disagreed on what was so obvious about my reasons. [19] Given the focus of the parties\u2019 submissions on my earlier reasons, I will set out in full my critical conclusions regarding the appropriate remedy at paras. 156-166: The Appropriate Remedy [156] In considering the appropriate remedy as between Helen and John, it bears repeating that determining a fit remedy is so fact-dependant that little guidance can be taken from comparing one case to another: Wilson at para. 56. [157] In the circumstances of Helen\u2019s claim against John and Broadway Towers, there is no evidence concerning what would happen to the shares of Peter, Helen and Dennis in the event of family discord and the prospect of future deadlock. Because of the conflicting affidavit evidence, I am not in a position to lay \u201cblame\u201d on any party for Helen\u2019s departure. I am determining the appropriate remedy in the context of irreconcilable family differences, not in the context of any wrongdoing. I cannot treat this as a case where Helen has been involuntarily ousted from Broadway Towers nor as a case where she is departing voluntarily. I also cannot take into account the stress experienced by John and Tassia any more than I can take into account how Helen feels about her experiences within the family and Broadway Towers. [158] There are, however, a number of factors which favour an earlier valuation date and/or greater discount. [159] For starters, right or wrong, Helen has had very little to do with the success of Broadway Towers. Even on her evidence, Helen\u2019s contributions are dated and minimal in relation to her father\u2019s contributions. Further, Helen\u2019s shares were issued as part of an estate freeze for estate planning purposes. She could never have expected to extract any value for her shares while her parents were alive. [160] On the other hand, a number of factors favour a current valuation date and/or no discount. [161] Helen\u2019s position with Broadway Towers has not changed. She was not expected to make a contribution to Broadway Towers in return for her shares. If not for the breakdown in family relationships, Helen would, in time, have derived substantial benefit from her shares in Broadway Towers, without any effort on her part whatsoever. [162] After having considered all of the circumstances, I consider the most appropriate and fair remedy to be that Broadway Towers or its nominee repurchase Helen\u2019s shares at their current fair market value discounted by 40%. [163] In my view, this valuation date and discount best meets the reasonable expectations of the parties in a way which is fair and least intrusive. Helen will still receive substantial value for her shares, with the discount reflecting that she will receive that value much earlier than she could reasonably have expected. At the same time, John will maintain control of Broadway Towers and, given Helen\u2019s willingness to receive payment over time, there is no reason for me to think that Lougheed Village would have to be sold or that John and Tassia\u2019s retirement income stream significantly impaired. [164] I have chosen a current valuation date because I expect that it will be easier and less expensive to complete than a historic one. Had I determined that an earlier valuation date would have been appropriate, I would have applied a lesser discount. In addition to ease of determination, from the perspective of fairness, I should add that, if land values had decreased rather than increased, I would have imposed the same remedy. [165] Accordingly, I order that Broadway Towers, or its nominee, purchase Helen\u2019s shares in Broadway Towers at their fair market value determined as of the date of this order by an independent business valuator who is satisfactory to each of Helen and John, discounted by 40%. The terms of payment are to be determined by Helen and John, failing which they can apply for directions. [166] John raised an issue at the hearing regarding the most appropriate valuation method but I received no evidence on the alternatives. If Helen and John are unable to agree on the valuation method, they can apply for directions. [20] Regrettably, imperfections in my reasons have caused the parties consternation. More regrettably, they did not simply ask me to clarify my reasons at a much earlier stage. [21] At this point, the only intellectually honest thing I can do is to provide the clarity that the parties could have and, with all due respect, should have sought much sooner. I consider it completely inappropriate for me to interpret my own reasons for judgment or to allow the parties to reargue their cases. While I do not consider it appropriate to bolster my previous reasons for judgment in any way, I do consider it necessary to add a few words of explanation. [22] In rendering my decision, I was fully aware that Helen\u2019s shareholdings in Broadway Towers would be very difficult to sell on the open market for a variety of reasons. They represented a minority shareholding within a closely held family company. They would not offer a theoretical third party purchaser control now or in the future. Further, they offered no dividend and would not offer a dividend for an unknown period of time. The circle of theoretical third party purchasers would be small and any theoretical sale would only be completed if the value of the shares was discounted. [23] When I awarded Helen the fair market value of her shares in Broadway Towers discounted by 40%, I intended for that to convey that I considered it \u201cfair\u201d to determine the fair market value of Broadway Towers and then apply a 40% discount to Helen\u2019s interest in Broadway Towers. I did not intend for any minority and/or marketability discount to be applied in addition to the 40% discount. Had I intended for any additional discount to be applied, I would have said so. [24] Further, when I awarded fair market value discounted at 40%, I intended for the fair market value of Broadway Towers to be determined based on what a willing buyer would pay a willing seller for all of the shares in Broadway Towers on the open market. I did not intend for the estimate of the fair market value of Broadway Towers\u2019 shares to be limited in any way by hypothetical conditions, such as an assumption that the commercial property owned by Broadway Towers would be subject to a non-existent restriction on development. [25] In this case, the income value approach to the valuation of Broadway Towers\u2019 shares does not reflect what I ordered. It is based on the assumption that the commercial property owned by Broadway Towers does not have re-development potential such that a theoretical third party purchaser would only be acquiring the current stream of income generated by Broadway Towers into the future. This is a false assumption. Broadway Towers does have re-development potential. A willing seller would never sell Broadway Towers to a willing purchaser based on the income value approach for $13,510,000 rather than on the highest and best use of the commercial property owned by Broadway Towers for $32,415,000. [1] [26] Even though John does not intend to re-develop the commercial property owned by Broadway Towers, for these reasons, Broadway Towers or its nominee must purchase Helen\u2019s shares based on the market value approach employed by Mr. Williamson discounted by 40%. According to Mr. Williamson\u2019s report, after making certain necessary and appropriate deductions from the market value of Broadway Towers, the purchase price for Helen\u2019s shares is $6,041,734. [27] In rendering my original decision, I was somewhat handicapped by the extent of the evidence adduced by the parties. I endeavoured to be sensitive to John\u2019s desire that he not be forced to sell Broadway Towers and that his and Tassia\u2019s retirement income from Broadway Towers not be unduly limited. Given Helen\u2019s flexibility regarding payment terms, I had no reason to think my order would produce either of these outcomes. I continue to have that view. [28] John has now adduced evidence regarding Broadway Towers\u2019 income, how much money he and Tassia require in their retirements and how much debt Broadway Towers can carry without impairing his and Tassia\u2019s retirement income. This information was not helpful to me in clarifying my original order regarding the valuation of Helen\u2019s shares in Broadway Towers but is helpful to me in setting out how Broadway Towers or its nominee can complete the purchase of Helen\u2019s shares. [29] Helen has very thoughtfully proposed that Broadway Towers or its nominee pay her $2,000,000 on the closing of the purchase of her shares. Helen would then have judgment against Broadway Towers for the balance of the purchase price, namely $4,041,734, with interest on the outstanding amount at the registrar\u2019s rate for post-judgment interest. Helen would be free to register her judgment against the title to property owned by Broadway Towers but enforcement of her judgment would otherwise be stayed pending certain events. [30] Subject to some relatively minor tweaking, mostly regarding the lifting of the stay, I will make the order sought by Helen. [31] In the previous application, John sought to defeat Helen\u2019s claims in relation to Broadway Towers in their entirety. He argued that her shares in Broadway Towers had not been validly issued or, in the alternative, if they had been validly issued that they were subject to a resulting trust in favour of John and Tassia. I rejected these arguments which resulted in a judgment in favour of Helen. While the remedy was only 60% of what Helen was seeking, she received a very significant award. I consider her to have been the substantially successful party. [32] Had Helen not advanced then abandoned oppression and unfair prejudice claims, I would have awarded her one-half of her costs of the previous application at Scale B. To recognize the time spent by John preparing for the claims that were abandoned at the last minute, I consider it appropriate to order John and Virvilis Holdings to pay her one-third of her costs of the previous application at Scale B. [33] I make the following order: 1. Helen\u2019s shares in Broadway Towers shall be purchased by Broadway Towers or its nominee for $6,041,734, with $2,000,000 to be paid on closing and the remainder to be paid over time. 2. The closing of the sale of Helen\u2019s shares in Broadway Towers shall occur on or before February 28, 2020, or such later date as agreed by the parties. 3. Helen shall transfer all of her shares in Broadway Towers on the closing date. 4. Helen shall have judgment against Broadway Towers for the balance of the purchase price in the amount of $4,041,734 (the \u201cMoney Judgment\u201d), with interest to be paid on the outstanding amount of the Money Judgment on and after March 1, 2020 at the registrar\u2019s rate for post-judgment interest that is in force from time to time. 5. On or after March 1, 2020, Helen may register the Money Judgment against the title to any real property owned by Broadway Towers. 6. Subject to paragraph 7 of this order, execution on the Money Judgment is otherwise stayed until: a. The later of the death of John or Tassia; b. Any change in control of Broadway Towers; or c. Any re-development of the property owned by Broadway Towers having a civic address of 403 North Road, Coquitlam, British Columbia. 7. On the happening of any of the events set out in paragraph 6 of this order, Helen has leave to apply to the court for an order lifting the stay of execution of the Money Judgment. 8. John and Broadway Towers must notify Helen immediately of any planned change in control of Broadway Towers or any planned re-development of the property owned by Broadway Towers having a civic address of 403 North Road, Coquitlam, British Columbia. 9. John and Virvilis Holdings shall, jointly and severally, pay Helen one-third of her costs of the application heard by the court on January 8-11, 2018 at Scale B. [34] As the entirely successful party, Helen shall also have her costs of the present application against John and Virvilis Holdings at Scale B. [35] I thank counsel for their assistance and wish the parties well. \u201cL.S. Marchand J.\u201d MARCHAND J. [1] Both of these values were determined by Mr. Williamson.",

        "text": "COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA Citation: Zhao v. Zhou, 2019 BCCA 12 Date: 20190108 Docket: CA45269 Between: Yu Rong Zhao Respondent (Plaintiff) And Shou Zhi Zhou Appellant (Defendant) Corrected Judgment: The text of the judgment was corrected on the front page on January 15, 2019. Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice Groberman The Honourable Mr. Justice Fitch The Honourable Madam Justice Griffin On appeal from: An order of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, dated April 10, 2018 ( Zhao v. Zhou , 2018 BCSC 567, Vancouver Docket S155364). Oral Reasons for Judgment Counsel for the Appellant: J.M. Richter A.M. James The Respondent, appearing in person: Y.R. Zhao (J. Mo, Interpreter) Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British Columbia January 4, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia January 8, 2019 Summary: The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant in China, alleging that he misappropriated corporate assets to which she was entitled, and failed to pay her on a promissory note. The defendant avoided service, and the claim was dismissed (with a right to re-file) on the basis of a lack of service. The plaintiff then brought a similar action in British Columbia. The defendant applied to have it dismissed for lack of territorial competence, and, in the alternative, sought to have the British Columbia courts decline jurisdiction on the basis that China was the appropriate forum. The chambers judge dismissed the application. He ruled that the court had territorial competence. While he accepted that a number of factors favoured declining jurisdiction in favour of China, he found that the defendant\u2019s failure to cooperate in the litigation in that country favoured having the matter proceed in British Columbia. On appeal, held: Appeal allowed in part. The judge\u2019s finding of territorial competence is not effectively challenged on appeal. A number of factors, however, show China to be a more appropriate forum: the subject matter of the litigation is most connected with China; Chinese law will be applicable, the witnesses are located in China, and the evidence will be presented in a Chinese language. The defendant asserts that he will respond to litigation in China. The British Columbia litigation should be temporarily stayed to allow the defendant to show that he will cooperate in having the litigation proceed in China. [1] GROBERMAN J.A. : In the court below, the defendant applied to strike the plaintiff\u2019s action on the basis that the court lacked territorial competence over it. In the alternative, he applied to have the court decline territorial competence on the basis that China is a more appropriate forum in which to adjudicate the claims. The judge held that the courts of British Columbia have territorial competence. While he considered that a number of factors point to China as the most suitable forum for the claims, he considered that the Supreme Court of British Columbia should, nonetheless, continue to exercise its territorial competence over them. He did so primarily on the basis that the defendant had engaged in conduct that impeded the plaintiff from proceeding in China. [2] As I will indicate, I agree with much of the judge\u2019s analysis, but consider that it is appropriate to grant a temporary stay of the British Columbia litigation with a view to allowing the matter to proceed in Chinese courts. There are marked advantages from the standpoint of the administration of justice to having the matter proceed in China, because: a) the subject matter of the litigation is more closely connected with China; b) the law of China will be the applicable law; c) witnesses are located in China; and d) most (perhaps all) of the evidence will be presented in a Chinese language. Background [3] The notice of civil claim in this matter is not well-drafted, but the parties have been of some assistance in clarifying the background of the action and describing the claims that are being pursued. [4] The parties were married to each other from February 17, 1997 to July 4, 2005, and again from September 7, 2005 to July 13, 2009. Both marriages and both divorces took place in China. The parties resided (at least some of the time) in Canada after March 24, 2008, though they have also resided in China. [5] In March 2000, during their first marriage, the parties incorporated a business in China. Ms. Zhao had a 20% interest in the business, and Mr. Zhou held a 70% interest, with the remaining 10% held by a relative of Ms. Zhao. Ms. Zhao claims the company was profitable, but says that Mr. Zhou took steps to conceal the profits and to appropriate them to himself. The pleadings are not entirely clear as to the mechanisms of the alleged misappropriation. Ultimately, however, she claims that Mr. Zhou took the company\u2019s assets, investing some of the money in a property in Burnaby which he continues to hold. [6] Ms. Zhao signed an agreement that purported to resolve all remaining differences between the parties at the time of the couple\u2019s second divorce. She says, however, that she was unaware of Mr. Zhou\u2019s misappropriations of business assets when she signed that agreement. [7] In May 2011, Ms. Zhao confronted Mr. Zhou and demanded compensation in respect of her interest in the business. The two met, in China, and Mr. Zhou signed a promissory note in the amount of \u00a54.2 million [1] in her favour. According to Ms. Zhao, the note represented agreed compensation for Mr. Zhou\u2019s misappropriations from the company. He says that it was nothing of the sort, and that the note was signed under duress and is unenforceable. [8] The parties agree that Mr. Zhou paid Ms. Zhao \u00a5100,000 in April 2012. Ms. Zhao claims that this was a payment on account of the promissory note. Mr. Zhou denies that, saying that the amount represented the final payment of amounts he owed in respect of the second divorce settlement. [9] The parties have subsequently been involved in three court actions in China. First, Mr. Zhou brought an action on December 6, 2012 to set aside the promissory note on grounds of duress. On December 21, 2012, Ms. Zhao brought her own action in a different Chinese court to enforce the promissory note. [10] On January 21, 2013, a court in China ordered Mr. Zhou\u2019s claim to be transferred to the court in which Ms. Zhao\u2019s claim was brought, so that the claims could be heard together. On January 30, 2013, however, Mr. Zhou applied to withdraw his claim, and his application was granted. [11] On May 15, 2013 Ms. Zhao obtained an order from the Chinese court freezing certain of Mr. Zhou\u2019s assets. She was unable, however, to locate and serve Mr. Zhou, resulting in the court dismissing her claim on June 6, 2013. The court dissolved the freeze order three days later. [12] The affidavit material filed in the court below indicates that Ms. Zhao\u2019s inability to serve Mr. Zhou was due to his refusal to provide her with an address, and his failure to make good on promises to appear and defend the matter in China. Those allegations appear to be supported by an official document authored by the judge who dismissed the claim on June 6, 2013. It appears that the dismissal was not a final order, and that Ms. Zhao was entitled to re-file her claim with the Chinese court. The parties have not been able to tell this Court whether she still retains that right. [13] The day before her action against Mr. Zhou was dismissed, Ms. Zhao commenced a separate action, in China, against the corporation. The corporation filed a defence, and successfully opposed an application for disclosure of corporate records. After further court proceedings, Ms. Zhao withdrew her claim on terms. It appears that some settlement was reached as to costs, and it is common ground that no claim remains against the company, [14] In the current British Columbia action, Ms. Zhao makes claims for damages against Mr. Zhou, as well as a tracing order to assert a trust claim in the Burnaby property. Territorial Competence [15] Territorial competence must be determined under s. 3 of the Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings Transfer Act , S.B.C. 2003, c. 28. The relevant provisions are as follows: 3. A court has territorial competence in a proceeding that is brought against a person only if \u2026 (d) that person is ordinarily resident in British Columbia at the time of the commencement of the proceeding, or (e) there is a real and substantial connection between British Columbia and the facts on which the proceeding against that person is based. [16] The judge described the proposition that Mr. Zhou was ordinarily resident in British Columbia when the action was commenced as \u201cdisputed and thinly supported\u201d. He nonetheless found that there was sufficient support for the proposition to satisfy the \u201carguable case\u201d threshold described in Purple Echo Productions, Inc. v. KCTS Television , 2008 BCCA 85. He therefore held that the courts of British Columbia had territorial competence over the claim under s. 3(d) of the statute. [17] The judge also considered that the court had territorial competence under s. 3(e). In doing so, he applied the presumptions set out in s. 10 of the statute. He considered that if Mr. Zhou was ordinarily resident in British Columbia when he committed the alleged wrongs, then it was arguable that they were committed in British Columbia. [18] The judge also found that the trust claim over the Burnaby property was a basis for finding a real and substantial connection with British Columbia. I would comment, however, that the notice of civil claim includes inconsistent claims, asserting a trust claim over the Burnaby property while also stating that the only claim under which a trust could arise was surrendered in exchange for a promissory note. If this matter ultimately proceeds in British Columbia, the notice of civil claim will need to be amended to clearly set out the nature of the claims being pursued. [19] On this appeal, Mr. Zhou does not challenge the judge\u2019s finding that the courts of British Columbia have territorial competence over the claims on the basis of s. 3(d). In my view, the judge\u2019s findings on that issue are sustainable, and it is therefore unnecessary to determine whether territorial competence is also established under s. 3(e). Discretion to Decline Territorial Competence [20] Section 11 of the Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings Transfer Act gives a court discretion to decline to exercise territorial competence: 11(1) After considering the interests of the parties to a proceeding and the ends of justice, a court may decline to exercise its territorial competence in the proceeding on the ground that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum in which to hear the proceeding. (2) A court, in deciding the question of whether it or a court outside British Columbia is the more appropriate forum in which to hear a proceeding, must consider the circumstances relevant to the proceeding, including (a) the comparative convenience and expense for the parties to the proceeding and for their witnesses, in litigating in the court or in any alternative forum, (b) the law to be applied to issues in the proceeding, (c) the desirability of avoiding multiplicity of legal proceedings, (d) the desirability of avoiding conflicting decisions in different courts, (e) the enforcement of an eventual judgment, and (f) the fair and efficient working of the Canadian legal system as a whole. [21] The judge found that the comparative convenience and expense considerations favoured having the matter proceed in China. He noted that nearly all of the evidence, witnesses and documents relevant to the case are in China, the documents are in Chinese, and the witnesses speak a Chinese language. [22] He also found that Chinese law will most probably be applicable in the proceeding, another factor making China the more appropriate forum for the litigation. The judge did note that the claim includes a tracing claim with respect to the Burnaby property, and that British Columbia may have some advantages as a forum in respect of that claim. [23] The judge was not convinced that avoiding a multiplicity of legal proceedings decisively favoured having the matter proceed in China. He noted that there is not, at present, any active litigation between the parties in that country. He did note, however, that the history of legal proceedings \u201cto some extent\u201d favoured having the matter proceed in China. [24] The judge did not consider the avoidance of conflicting decisions in different courts to be a relevant consideration in this case, given the absence of any determination of the issues on the merits in the Chinese courts. Accordingly, he described that consideration as a neutral factor. [25] The judge did find one factor favouring the exercise by the Supreme Court of its territorial competence: [89] [T]he plaintiff raises an issue of fundamental fairness. She argues that the defendant ought not to be heard to argue that China is clearly the more appropriate forum for the resolution of this dispute when he avoided service there (and, she adds, breached a promise he made to the Chinese court to attend court and deal with the claim)\u2026. \u2026 [91] In the absence of a response from the defendant to the plaintiff\u2019s allegations as to why the proceedings in China never progressed to the point of addressing the merits, I agree with the plaintiff that the interest of fairness weighs in favour of allowing this action to proceed. Did the Judge Err in Deciding to Exercise Territorial Jurisdiction? [26] In my view, the judge took note of appropriate factors under s. 11 of the Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings Transfer Act . I would note, however, that there is no discussion in his judgment of the extraordinarily difficult task that would face a British Columbia court in trying this action. The proceedings are likely to be very lengthy, given that the evidence will be heard in translation, and the court will require thorough explanation of the foreign law and corporate culture. The difficulties inherent in deciding issues of credibility in such circumstances should not be underestimated. [27] It is fair to say that the judge found that the various factors overwhelmingly favoured China as the appropriate forum for resolution of the litigation. He was justifiably troubled, however, by the fact that Ms. Zhao\u2019s attempt to litigate the matter in China had been thwarted by Mr. Zhou\u2019s actions. [28] In the result, the judge refused Mr. Zhou\u2019s application for the court to decline territorial competence in favour of China. The judge\u2019s order includes the following: 2. The defendant\u2019s application in the alternative for an order pursuant to Rule 21-8(2) of the Supreme Court Civil Rules and section 11 of the [ Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings Transfer Act ] staying some or all of the claims against the defendant in this proceeding on the ground that the Court ought to decline to exercise jurisdiction over him in respect of the said claims be and hereby is dismissed [29] In this Court, Mr. Zhou, through his counsel, has indicated that he is prepared to be cooperative in having this matter proceed in China. He has agreed to accept service of process through his Canadian counsel, and has represented that he is now prepared to defend this matter in China. [30] In my view, these promises, if kept, effectively deal with the concerns of the chambers judge. [31] In the result, I am of the view that it was premature for the judge to determine that the Supreme Court of British Columbia should exercise territorial competence in this matter. Instead, it should do so only if it becomes clear that the Chinese courts are unable to adjudicate the matter. [32] I would set aside paragraph 2 of the judge\u2019s order, and substitute the following: 2. The defendant\u2019s application pursuant to Rule 21-8(2) of the Supreme Court Civil Rules and section 11 of the [ Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings Transfer Act ], staying this action on the ground that the Court ought to decline to exercise jurisdiction over the action is granted, and the action is stayed for a period of six months to allow proceedings to be commenced or continued in China. [33] The parties are at liberty to apply to the Supreme Court of British Columbia to extend, make permanent, or lift the stay. It should be apparent, within the six month period, whether Mr. Zhou is being forthright in saying that he will cooperate in having this matter determined in China. That information will be of great importance to the Supreme Court in deciding how to exercise its discretion. [34] The six month stay will also allow the parties to establish whether the claims can, in fact, proceed in China, and whether those proceedings will be efficient. That information will assist the Supreme Court in determining whether British Columbia should decline to exercise its territorial competence. [35] The stay will expire in six months if the Supreme Court does not make an order extending it. It will be up to the parties to make an application to that court within the six month period. If the Supreme Court makes no order in respect of the stay, Ms. Zhao will be able to continue with the British Columbia action. [36] There is a certificate of pending litigation registered against the Burnaby property. The parties are agreed that it should remain in place during the temporary stay. I agree. For at least the six month period, this litigation remains pending, though it is in a state of suspension. [37] I would not disturb the award of costs in the court below. In my view, success is divided in this Court, and I would order that the parties bear their own costs of the appeal. [38] FITCH J.A. : I agree. [39] GRIFFIN J.A. : I agree. [40] GROBERMAN J.A. : The appeal is allowed to the extent set out in my reasons. Costs in the court below remain as ordered by that court. Each party will bear their own costs in this Court. \u201cThe Honourable Mr. Justice Groberman\u201d [1] I use \u201c\u00a5\u201d here to refer to refer to the Chinese currency, known as the \u201cRenminbi\u201d or \u201cYuan\u201d. I understand the current exchange rate to be approximately \u00a55.13 to one Canadian dollar.",

        "text": "COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA Citation: Yang v. Wang, 2021 BCCA 56 Date: 20210203 Docket: CA47038 Between: Zhongwu Yang Respondent (Plaintiff) And Zi An Wang aka Zian Wang Appellant (Defendant) Before: The Honourable Madam Justice Saunders The Honourable Mr. Justice Groberman The Honourable Madam Justice Stromberg-Stein On appeal from: An order of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, dated August 11, 2020 ( Yang v. Wang , 2020 BCSC 1176, Vancouver Docket S151416). Oral Reasons for Judgment The Appellant, appearing in person (via videoconference): Z. Wang Counsel for the Respondent (via videoconference): J. Jiang Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British Columbia February 3, 2021 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia February 3, 2021 Summary: The appellant applied to a Supreme Court judge to set aside a default judgment on a promissory note. The default judgment was granted on December 7, 2015. The appellant claims not to have known of the judgment, or of the action against him, until after a garnishing order was entered on February 22, 2016. Even after becoming aware of the judgment, however, he delayed bringing an application to set it aside for four years. The judge refused to set aside the default judgment, finding that he met none of the criteria for such an order. On appeal, the appellant seeks to file additional evidence. Held: Application to adduce additional evidence denied; appeal dismissed. The appellant provides no adequate reason for his failure to adduce the evidence at first instance, and it is, in any event, only tangentially relevant to the application. The chambers judge applied the correct test to setting aside a default judgment, and made no errors in her findings. [1] GROBERMAN J.A. : This is an appeal from a refusal by a judge of the Supreme Court to set aside a default judgment. There is, along with the appeal, an application to adduce fresh evidence. [2] The underlying proceeding was commenced in February 2015. It alleged that the respondent lent the appellant $90,000, and that the appellant gave the respondent a promissory note in December 2013, undertaking to repay the loan by the end of 2014. The entire balance of the loan remained unpaid at the date the action was commenced. [3] The respondent made several attempts to serve the plaintiff with the notice of civil claim, both at his residence and at his place of work. It appears that the appellant was evading service. On October 16, 2015, a master granted an order for substitutional service, requiring the respondent to serve the appellant at his work email address, and by registered mail to a business address. [4] On December 7, 2015, after finding that the appellant had failed to file an appearance within the time limited following substitutional service, default judgment was entered. A garnishing order followed on February 22, 2016. The appellant became aware of the garnishing order by March 4, 2016. He did not apply to set aside the default judgment for over four years, filing his notice of application on June 2, 2020. [5] The appellant\u2019s explanation for his delay relates to his mother\u2019s mental condition. Without any details or medical evidence, he states that his mother suffered a recurrence of depression in 2014, and that the depression lasted for a considerable length of time. In his affidavit, he says: [When] I receive[d] the default judgment [in] this case[,] I hesitated and chose not [to respond to] the judgment. It was only because of my worry [about] my mother\u2019s mental condition. [6] In his oral submissions today, the appellant also made reference to his youth and the fact that he had not grown up in Canada, suggesting that his naivety with respect to the court system was also an important factor. [7] In her comprehensive reasons for judgment, the judge set out the history of the case, and applied the factors in Miracle Feeds v. D. & H. Enterprises Ltd. (1979), 10 B.C.L.R. 58 at 61 (Co. Ct.) to decide whether to exercise her discretion to set aside the judgment. It has long been accepted in this Province that those are the correct factors to consider on an application to set aside a default judgment. [8] The judge found that the appellant had been properly served with the civil claim. Although she did not say so in terms, it is clear that she concluded that he was either aware of the civil action in 2015, before default judgment was issued, or, if he was unaware of it, it was through deliberate efforts on his part to avoid receipt of the notice of civil claim. [9] She found that when he became aware of the default judgment in 2016, he failed to move expeditiously to set it aside, and that his failure was wilful and deliberate. The mere statement that his mother was depressed had little evidentiary value, and did not serve, in any way, to explain why he could not have moved to set the judgment aside. [10] The judge also found that the affidavit material filed by the appellant did not establish that there was a defence worthy of investigation, let alone a meritorious defence to the action. She noted, as well, that many of the appellant\u2019s allegations were not supported by affidavit evidence. [11] Finally, she found that the passage of time served to prejudice the respondent in his ability to prove his case. [12] I can detect no error in the judge\u2019s approach or analysis. [13] The application to this Court to adduce fresh evidence seeks to introduce some banking records and includes other documents that provide some support for certain aspects of the appellant\u2019s version of the facts surrounding his financial dealings with the respondent. The material does not meet the test in Palmer v. The Queen , [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759. There is no adequate explanation as to why the evidence could not, with due diligence, have been adduced in the court below. The evidence is, in any event, tangential to the issues in the case, and far from conclusive on any issue that is critical to the claim. [14] None of the arguments or characterizations of fact presented today cast doubt on the judge\u2019s findings. In particular, it is apparent that the appellant wilfully failed to respond to the notice of civil claim, and then unreasonably delayed in moving to set aside the default judgment. He still does not present any meritorious defence to the respondent\u2019s claim. [15] I would affirm the judgment below and dismiss the appeal. [16] SAUNDERS J.A. : I agree. [17] STROMBERG-STEIN J.A. : I agree. [18] SAUNDERS J.A. : The appeal is dismissed. \u201cThe Honourable Mr. Justice Groberman\u201d",

        "text": "IN THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA Citation: Watson v. Scouts Canada, 2020 BCSC 41 Date: 20200114 Docket: S1811356 Registry: Vancouver In the Matter of the Judicial Review Procedure Act , R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 241 Between: Andrew Donald Watson, P. Eng Petitioner And Scouts Canada Respondent Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice Skolrood Reasons for Judgment Counsel for the Petitioner: J. Rai Counsel for the Respondent: E.E. Vanderburgh Place and Date of Trial/Hearing: Vancouver, B.C. October 4, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, B.C. January 14, 2020 [1] This is an application brought by the respondent Scouts Canada pursuant to R. 21-8 of the Supreme Court Civil Rules to strike out portions of the petition on the basis that this Court lacks jurisdiction. [2] The petition advances a claim for judicial review under the Judicial Review Procedure Act , R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 241 [ JRPA ], of a decision by Scouts Canada to terminate the membership of the respondent Andrew Donald Watson. [3] The central question on this application is whether the claims raised in the impugned paragraphs of the petition fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Court pursuant to s. 18 of the Federal Courts Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7 [ FCA ]. [4] It is not necessary to review in great detail the background facts to the judicial review application, however I will provide a brief overview. [5] Mr. Watson is a professional engineer who was involved with Scouts Canada for approximately 43 years. On November 2, 2017, Scouts Canada terminated his membership (the \u201cTermination Decision\u201d). This followed a temporary suspension issued on or about May 12, 2017, for conduct allegedly in violation of Scouts Canada\u2019s code of conduct and a subsequent review by Scouts Canada\u2019s national review committee. The reasons for the suspension and ultimate termination are not relevant to this application. [6] Scouts Canada is a corporation continued pursuant to a federal statute, An Act respecting Scouts Canada , S.C. 2007, c. 38 [ Scouts Canada Act ]. Under s. 7 of the Scouts Canada Act , Scouts Canada is empowered to pass bylaws governing a number of matters, including membership. [7] Pursuant to this power, Scouts Canada has enacted a bylaw setting out different categories of membership. Scouts Canada has also established a comprehensive set of policies and procedures governing the affairs of the organization, including the investigation and discipline of members. [8] Scouts Canada\u2019s termination of Mr. Watson\u2019s membership was purportedly done in accordance with the bylaw and its policies and procedures. [9] On October 22, 2018, the petition was filed seeking judicial review. Scouts Canada filed its response on December 7, 2018. [10] The matter proceeded to a hearing on April 4, 2019, but it was adjourned to permit Scouts Canada to raise the jurisdictional issue underlying its present application. Scouts Canada did not challenge this Court\u2019s jurisdiction in its response to petition, however on April 17, 2019, it filed a jurisdictional response. [11] Section 2(2) of the JRPA is the key operative section in respect of Mr. Watson\u2019s application for judicial review: (2) On an application for judicial review, the court may grant any relief that the applicant would be entitled to in any one or more of the proceedings for: (a) relief in the nature of mandamus, prohibition or certiorari; (b) a declaration or injunction, or both, in relation to the exercise, refusal to exercise, or proposed or purported exercise, of a statutory power. [12] Scouts Canada relies on s. 18(1) of the FCA which states: 18 (1) Subject to section 28, the Federal Court has exclusive original jurisdiction (a) to issue an injunction, writ of certiorari , writ of prohibition, writ of mandamus or writ of quo warranto , or grant declaratory relief, against any federal board, commission or other tribunal; and (b) to hear and determine any application or other proceeding for relief in the nature of relief contemplated by paragraph (a), including any proceeding brought against the Attorney General of Canada, to obtain relief against a federal board, commission or other tribunal. [13] Section 28 of the FCA , which is referred to in s. 18, confers exclusive jurisdiction on the Federal Court of Appeal to hear judicial review applications in respect of certain enumerated tribunals. That section has no application here. [14] Section 2(1) of the FCA defines \u201cfederal board, commission or other tribunal\u201d to mean: \u2026 any body, person or persons having, exercising or purporting to exercise jurisdiction or powers conferred by or under an Act of Parliament \u2026 [15] Both parties cite the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Highwood Congregation of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses (Judicial Committee) v. Wall , 2018 SCC 26. While this case is more applicable to the merits of Mr. Watson\u2019s judicial review application, the analysis also helps inform the jurisdictional issue. [16] Wall involved an application for judicial review of a decision of a congregation of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses to expel a member. The Alberta Court of Queen\u2019s Bench and the Court of Appeal both held that the courts had jurisdiction to consider the application, but the Supreme Court of Canada disagreed. [17] In finding that judicial review was not available, Justice Rowe, speaking for the Court, said: [ 14 ] Not all decisions are amenable to judicial review under a superior court\u2019s supervisory jurisdiction. Judicial review is only available where there is an exercise of state authority and where that exercise is of a sufficiently public character. Even public bodies make some decisions that are private in nature \u2014 such as renting premises and hiring staff \u2014 and such decisions are not subject to judicial review: Air Canada v. Toronto Port Authority , 2011 FCA 347 , [2013] 3 F.C.R. 605 , at para. 52 . In making these contractual decisions, the public body is not exercising \u201ca power central to the administrative mandate given to it by Parliament\u201d, but is rather exercising a private power ( ibid. ). Such decisions do not involve concerns about the rule of law insofar as this refers to the exercise of delegated authority. [ 15 ] Further, while the private law remedies of declaration or injunction may be sought in an application for judicial review (see, for example, Judicial Review Procedure Act , R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 241, s. 2(2)(b); Judicial Review Procedure Act , R.S.O. 1990, c. J.1, s. 2(1)2; Judicial Review Act , R.S.P.E.I. 1988, c. J-3, ss. 2 and 3(3)), this does not make the reverse true. Public law remedies such as certiorari may not be granted in litigation relating to contractual or property rights between private parties: Knox , at para. 17. Certiorari is only available where the decision-making power at issue has a sufficiently public character: D. J. M. Brown and J. M. Evans, with the assistance of D. Fairlie, Judicial Review of Administrative Action in Canada (loose-leaf), at topic 1:2252. \u2026 [ 20 ] In my view, these cases do not make judicial review available for private bodies. Courts have questioned how a private Act \u2014 like that for the United Church of Canada \u2014 that does not confer statutory authority can attract judicial review: see Greaves v. United Church of God Canada , 2003 BCSC 1365 , 27 C.C.E.L. (3d) 46 , at para. 29 ; Setia , at para. 36. The problem with the cases that rely on Setia is that they hold that where a decision has a broad public impact, the decision is of a sufficient public character and is therefore reviewable: Graff , at para. 18; West Toronto United Football Club , at para. 24. These cases fail to distinguish between \u201cpublic\u201d in a generic sense and \u201cpublic\u201d in a public law sense. In my view, a decision will be considered to be public where it involves questions about the rule of law and the limits of an administrative decision maker\u2019s exercise of power. Simply because a decision impacts a broad segment of the public does not mean that it is public in the administrative law sense of the term. Again, judicial review is about the legality of state decision making. [18] It is common ground between the parties that if Scouts Canada falls within the definition of a \u201cfederal board, commission or other tribunal\u201d, then the Federal Court has exclusive jurisdiction to judicially review its decisions: see Canada (Attorney General) v. TeleZone Inc. , 2010 SCC 62 at para. 47; Ehattesaht First Nation v. British Columbia (Agriculture and Lands) , 2011 BCSC 658 at para. 23, leave to appeal ref\u2019d 2011 BCCA 325. [19] Somewhat ironically, Scouts Canada takes the position that it is not in fact a \u201cfederal board, commission or other tribunal\u201d. In its response to the petition, Scouts Canada describes itself and the Termination Decision as follows, at para. 16: Scouts Canada, its agents, employees, officers and volunteers have no statutory decision-making authority and do not act on behalf of the federal or any provincial government or any state-actor. The Decision is a private decision concerning membership in a voluntary association that is not reviewable by the courts, either by way of judicial review or in a private law action. [20] Scouts Canada does not dispute that if its characterization is correct, that it is a private, voluntary association, this Court has jurisdiction to determine whether the Termination Decision had a sufficiently public character to nonetheless render it subject to judicial review. [21] However, Scouts Canada submits that it is the manner in which Mr. Watson has framed the judicial review application that gives rise to the jurisdictional issue and its application to strike. Scouts Canada points in particular to the following parargraphs of the petition: 65. Scouts Canada is established by an act of [Parliament]. Its powers, including powers to enact bylaws concerning membership and discipline of its members, are conferred by the Scouts Canada Act . This Act operates as a statutory grant of authority and the decision to terminate the Petitioner\u2019s membership is a statutory decision subject to judicial review. However, even if Scouts Canada is considered a domestic tribunal, the nature of its decisions regarding investigation of complaints and discipline of its members have a sufficiently public character such that the termination decision is subject to judicial review. (As noted above, Scouts Canada acknowledges that the second ground raised in the last sentence of para. 65 is within this Court\u2019s jurisdiction to determine). 66. Scouts Canada is created by a federal statute, but judicial review is within the purview of the provincial superior courts, not the Federal Court as Scouts Canada is not a federal board, commission or tribunal [or] enumerated in s. 28 of the [ FCA ]. \u2026 73. \u2026 a. In Wall , the Court observed that incorporation by a private Act does not necessarily operate as a statutory grant of authority but held that a decision is sufficiently public in character, and therefore reviewable, if it involves \u201cquestions about the rule of law and the limits of an administrative decision maker\u2019s exercise of power\u201d. The decision to terminate the Petitioner\u2019s membership in Scouts Canada, purportedly in accordance with bylaws enacted pursuant to the Scouts Canada Act , squarely puts in issue the legality of Scouts Canada\u2019s decision-making and raises questions regarding respect for and compliance with the rule of law. [22] Scouts Canada submits that on the face of the petition, in particular the first part of para. 65, Mr. Watson alleges that in making the Termination Decision, Scouts Canada was exercising a statutory power under a federal statute (the Scouts Canada Act ) which brings the Termination Decision squarely within the ambit of s. 18 of the FCA . [23] However, this is not Mr. Watson\u2019s position. As reflected in part in para. 66 of the petition, reproduced above, although created by a federal statute, Mr. Watson argues Scouts Canada is not a \u201cfederal board, commission or other tribunal\u201d and s. 18 of the FCA does not apply. [24] Mr. Watson cites Cameron v. Albrich , 2011 BCSC 549, where the court observed that not every exercise of a power conferred by a federal statute renders the decision-maker a \u201cfederal board, commission or other tribunal\u201d (at paras. 46-48). [25] Mr. Watson also cites Canadian Judicial Council v. Girouard , 2019 FCA 148, where the court confirmed the two-part test for determining whether a body is a \u201cfederal board, commission or other tribunal\u201d (at para. 34): a) What jurisdiction or power is the body seeking to exercise; and b) What is the source or origin of that jurisdiction or power? [26] Mr. Watson submits that there needs to be a more thorough assessment of this test in order to determine whether Scouts Canada meets the definition of a \u201cfederal board, commission or other tribunal\u201d, something which is beyond the proper scope of this application to strike. [27] Mr. Watson submits further that the impugned paragraphs deal with the statutory framework within which the Termination Decision was made, which is relevant to determining whether Scouts Canada is a public decision-maker or if the activities in question have a sufficiently public character, to render the Termination Decision subject to judicial review. [28] As I have noted, Scouts Canada\u2019s application to strike on jurisdictional grounds is based on a premise that both it and Mr. Watson reject, namely that it is a \u201cfederal board, commission or other tribunal\u201d. [29] Nonetheless, Scouts Canada submits that Mr. Watson has pleaded jurisdictional facts that, if true, establish that it meets the definition as such and falls within s. 18 of the FCA . Scouts Canada submits further that its application must be determined on the basis as the facts as pleaded. [30] The difficulty with this position is that the impugned paragraphs (65, 66 and 73(a)) all appear in the \u201cLegal Basis\u201d section of the petition rather than the \u201cFactual Basis\u201d section. Each of the paragraphs contains statements that are in the nature of legal arguments or conclusions rather than facts. In particular, para. 73(a) advances an argument that on its face is intended to bring the Termination Decision in line with the principles set out in Wall . I therefore do not agree with Scouts Canada that these paragraphs plead jurisdictional facts that bring the claim within the scope of s. 18 of the FCA . [31] While the language used in para. 65 does potentially give rise to a question about the applicability of s. 18 of the FCA , that paragraph must be read alongside para. 66 where it is alleged that Scouts Canada is not in fact a \u201cfederal board, commission or other tribunal\u201d. [32] Further, I agree with Mr. Watson that the statutory framework is relevant to determining the true character of Scouts Canada, i.e. public or private body, and the nature of the Termination Decision. Both the statutory framework in which a decision-maker operates and the nature of the decision itself must be considered when determining whether judicial review is available (see Strauss v. North Fraser Pretrial Centre (Deputy Warden of Operations) , 2019 BCCA 207 at para. 40). [33] As noted above at para. 20 and parenthetically at para. 21, Scouts Canada concedes that this Court has jurisdiction to hear that part of the petition that alleges the Termination Decision was sufficiently public in character as to attract judicial review under s. 2(2)(a) of the JRPA . Thus, even if the impugned paragraphs could be struck because of the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Court under s. 18 of the FCA (which I do not agree is warranted), they are relevant to issues that properly fall within this Court\u2019s jurisdiction. [34] Finally, if Scouts Canada succeeds on this application, with the result being that Mr. Watson must bring part of his judicial application in the Federal Court, it is quite possible that the Federal Court will decline jurisdiction on the ground that Scouts Canada is not in fact a \u201cfederal board, commission or other tribunal\u201d. That no doubt is the position that Scouts Canada would take which, if successful, would ultimately result in the parties returning back before this Court. Such a result would be inconsistent with the objective of securing a \u201cjust, speedy and inexpensive determination\u201d of the petition: Supreme Court Civil Rules , R. 1-3(1). [35] The better approach, in my view, is for the proper characterization of Scouts Canada to be determined in this proceeding in a hearing on the merits of the petition. [36] Scouts Canada\u2019s application to strike portions of the petition is dismissed. [37] Costs will be in the cause. \u201cSkolrood J.\u201d",

        "text": "COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA Citation: Szopa v. Canada (Attorney General), 2020 BCCA 47 Date: 20200128 Docket: CA45625 Between: Stanislaw Szopa Appellant (Plaintiff) And The Attorney General of Canada Respondent (Defendant) Before: The Honourable Madam Justice Bennett The Honourable Mr. Justice Willcock The Honourable Mr. Justice Goepel On an application to vary: An order of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, dated December 10, 2018 ( Szopa v. Canada (Attorney General) , Vancouver Docket CA45625). Oral Reasons for Judgment The Appellant, appearing in person: S. Szopa Counsel for the Respondent: A. Gardner Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British Columbia January 28, 2020 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia January 28, 2020 Summary: The appellant seeks to vary an order of a justice that dismissed his application for leave to appeal an order which had dismissed his action as showing no cause of action. In the event, this Court converts the appellant\u2019s notice of application for leave to appeal into a notice of appeal, the respondent seeks an order quashing the appeal on the basis that it is devoid of merit. Held: The appellant was entitled to bring his appeal as of right notwithstanding its lack of merit. Accordingly, the order is varied and the notice of application for leave to appeal is converted into a notice of appeal. The appeal is however devoid of any arguable merit and respondent\u2019s application to quash the appeal is allowed. [1] GOEPEL J.A. : The appellant seeks to vary an order of a justice, pronounced on December 10, 2018, which dismissed his application for leave to appeal the August 30, 2018 order of Mr. Justice Macintosh which had dismissed his action as showing no cause of action. He also seeks a no-fee order. [2] In the event this Court converts the appellant\u2019s notice of application for leave to appeal into a notice of appeal, the respondent seeks an order quashing the appeal on the basis that it is devoid of merit. In the alternative, the respondent seeks an order for security for costs of the appeal in the amount of $3,000. [3] The appellant emigrated from Poland with his family in 1981. In Poland, he had earned a master\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering. In the process of immigrating to Canada, he interacted with an official of the Canadian Embassy in Vienna. That official marked down on his application for immigration that his profession was \u201cautomobile mechanic\u201d rather than \u201cmaster mechanical engineer\u201d. [4] The appellant is of the view that because of that mistake on his papers, he could not find employment in Canada that was suitable to his training and skills. He alleges the government forced him to work in jobs that were beneath him and as a result, he and his family suffered economically and emotionally. He also says the government had a duty to properly inform him of the economic circumstances in Canada in 1981. [5] On February 28, 2018, the appellant commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court alleging that he had been mislead, that the government had made misrepresentations to him and that he should have a remedy for those wrongs. He claimed $23 million in damages, resulting from his loss of employment income from not being able to work as a mechanical engineer in Canada. He also claimed damages for mental distress resulting from his lower standard of living because of the work he was required to undertake. [6] The respondent applied to have the action struck out as disclosing no cause of action. On August 30, 2018, Justice Macintosh struck out the claim. His reasons are indexed at 2018 BCSC 2164. [7] The appellant then filed a notice of application for leave to appeal. That application, together with an application for a no-fee order came on for hearing in this Court on December 10, 2018. The chambers judge dismissed his application for leave to appeal. She did so on the basis that the action was without merit. In that regard she said: [10] My task on an application for leave to appeal is to act as a gatekeeper \u2013 to ensure that judicial resources are not expended on matters that do not merit the attention of a full division of this Court, but also to ensure that self-represented litigants do not expend the money and effort to put forward an appeal that would ultimately results in costs orders being made against them. [11] When I look at the decision of Mr. Justice MacIntosh, it is apparent that he read the claim very liberally. He looked past some of the deficiencies in the form, recognizing Mr. Szopa is a self-represented litigant. He considered whether it would be possible, if the claim was re-framed, to establish a claim for negligent misrepresentation. The judge concluded that it could not be. He found that Mr. Szopa\u2019s claim did not fall into the category of a novel claim, which has a reasonable prospect of being recognized at common law. In other words, the judge looked at the claim and asked if this was the kind of claim, like the Tobacco litigation, where the court would move incrementally to recognize this as an appropriate case to expand the law and permit someone to bring forward this kind of claim. He concluded that it did not have that kind of prospect. I agree with Mr. Justice MacIntosh, as the law is quite settled and it does not appear that there would be any prospect that this claim would be recognized. There is also the problem of the limitation period. As the judge explained, this is a claim that arose in 1981. Even recognizing that Mr. Szopa has had some mental health problems, he was capable of asserting his concerns to the newspaper, for example, and of bringing them to the attention of the government. It seems Mr. Szopa, that despite your disabilities, you are a person capable of commencing a legal action by filing a notice of civil claim, as you have. There is not enough in the record to suggest that for the more than 30 years that have passed, you were unable to bring an action, to start a case and proceed with the litigation. So, for that reason too, it seems to me that your claim would be bound to fail. Ultimately, you would have to convince a division of this Court that Mr. Justice MacIntosh made errors which would warrant overturning his decision and reinstating your notice of civil claim. That, in my view, would not happen, even before a full division. [12] For these reasons, I have to dismiss the application for leave to appeal. As that is the case, it is not necessary for me to fully address the application for no-fee status or for the extensions of time. I would dismiss those applications as well as they fall because the leave to appeal cannot be granted. [8] The appellant did not immediately seek a review of the chambers judge\u2019s order. Rather, he filed a notice of application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. That application was dismissed as premature. [9] On November 4, 2019, the appellant applied in chambers for an order extending the time to seek a review of the order of the chambers judge dismissing his application for leave to appeal. On that hearing, the respondent conceded that the appellant did not require leave to appeal the order striking his claim. The appellant had an appeal as of right. This point, however, apparently had not been brought to the attention of the chambers judge when the leave to appeal application was heard in chambers. In the result, Mr. Justice Hunter granted the required extension of time to review the chambers judgment. [10] In Gonzalez v. British Columbia (Attorney General) , 2019 BCCA 88, this Court discussed the procedure to be followed when a party has a right to appeal but mistakenly brings an application for leave to appeal. In such circumstances, the chambers judge should convert, nunc pro tunc , the notice of application for leave to appeal into a notice of appeal and although a chambers judge may exercise discretion in granting the conversion, in exercising that discretion no consideration should be given to the merits of the proposed appeal. [11] That is the situation on this application. The appellant was entitled to bring his appeal as of right notwithstanding its lack of merit. The respondent does not suggest otherwise. Accordingly, I would allow the review and convert the notice of application for leave to appeal into a notice of appeal. [12] While the Court cannot consider the merits in regards to the conversion of the notice of leave to appeal into a notice of appeal, the merits are crucial to the other applications before the Court. The respondent seeks to quash the appeal because it is devoid of merit. The merits of the proposed appeal are also key to the determination of the no-fee and security for costs applications. [13] This Court has the inherent jurisdiction to quash an appeal that is so devoid of merit or substance as to constitute an abuse of the Court\u2019s own procedure: Milani v. Milani , 2019 BCCA 361 at para. 13. In Milani , Justice Smith, speaking for the Court, said: [13] In these circumstances, I find Mr. Milani\u2019s appeal of the Clarification Decision to be so devoid of any arguable merit as to amount to an abuse of process. This Court has the inherent jurisdiction to quash such an appeal as was confirmed in Kaiser (Re) , 2007 BCCA 253 at paras. 15\u201316: [15] Mr. Nicholson, for the trustee, cited Wiens v. Vancouver (City) (1992), 74 B.C.L.R. (2d) 154 (C.A.) as authority for the inherent jurisdiction of the Court to quash. Gibbs J.A., speaking for the Court, said at para. 3: There is ample authority for the principle that this Court has inherent jurisdiction to quash an appeal which is so devoid of merit or substance as to constitute an abuse of the Court\u2019s own procedure. See, for example. Singh (Banns) v. Bank of Montreal (1979), [1980] 3 W.W.R. 403, 18 B.C.L.R. 149, 15 C.P.C. 89, 109 D.L.R. (3d) 117 (C.A.), and this passage from National Life Assurance Co. v. McCoubrey, [1926] S.C.R. 277, [1926] 2 D.L.R. 550 quoted therein [p. 118 D.L.R.]: \u201cEvery Court of Justice has an inherent jurisdiction to prevent such an abuse of its own procedure ( Reichel v. Magrath (1889), 14 App. Cas. 665, at p. 668). If an appeal, though within its jurisdiction, be manifestly entirely devoid of merit or substance, this Court will entertain favourably a motion to quash it, as it does in cases where costs only are involved \u2026 as a convenient way of disposing of the appeal before further costs have been incurred.\u201d [16] But this is a power of the Court constituted as a division. The Act does not give the power to a single justice in chambers. [14] In this case, the chambers judge held that the appeal was without merit and would be bound to fail. I can see no errors in her conclusion. The appeal is so devoid of any arguable merit as to amount to an abuse of process. In the result, therefore, I would grant the respondent\u2019s application and order the appeal be quashed. It follows the review of the appeal of the no-fee order is dismissed and it is not necessary to deal with the security for costs application. [15] Given the manner in which this appeal has come forward today, I would make no order as to costs. [16] BENNETT J.A. : I agree. [17] WILLCOCK J.A. : I agree. [18] BENNETT J.A. : The application of Mr. Szopa to set aside the refusal of leave to appeal is allowed, by consent. Leave to appeal was not required. The application by the Attorney General of Canada to have the appeal quashed is granted. It follows that the review of the refusal of the no-fee status is dismissed. Each party will bear their own costs. \u201cThe Honourable Mr. Justice Goepel\u201d",

        "text": "COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA Citation: Staetter v. British Columbia (Adult Forensic Psychiatric Services), 2022 BCCA 14 Date: 20220105 Docket: CA47739 Between: Christopher Michael Staetter Appellant And The Director of Adult Forensic Psychiatric Services and Attorney General of British Columbia Respondents Before: The Honourable Madam Justice Saunders The Honourable Madam Justice Griffin The Honourable Mr. Justice Abrioux On appeal from: A disposition of the British Columbia Review Board, dated August 4, 2021. Oral Reasons for Judgment The Appellant, appearing in person (via videoconference): C. Staetter Counsel for the Respondent Director of Adult Forensic Psychiatric Services (via videoconference): D.K Lovett, Q.C. Counsel for the Respondent Attorney General of British Columbia (via videoconference): J.L. Fogel Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British Columbia January 5, 2022 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia January 5, 2022 Summary: The appellant seeks to change the conditions imposed on him as terms of a conditional discharge by the British Columbia Review Board. Held: Appeal dismissed. The decision of the Review Board was reasonable and supported by the evidence. [1] GRIFFIN J.A. : Mr. Christopher Michael Staetter appeals the August 4, 2021, disposition of the British Columbia Review Board (\u201cReview Board\u201d) maintaining his conditional discharge. [2] On October 19, 2012, Mr. Staetter was found not criminally responsible by reason of mental disorder (\u201cNCRMD\u201d) for charges of uttering threats and criminal harassment. The index offences arose from Mr. Staetter\u2019s deeply entrenched delusions that he had a sexual relationship with a teenage girl, P.H., in 2004 and that she subsequently gave birth to his son. Mr. Staetter sent P.H. and her father many disturbing, violent and threatening voicemails and text messages in 2012. This conduct has deeply affected the victims. [3] Before today\u2019s hearing we have had the opportunity to look at the evidence before the Review Board, the reasons of the Review Board, Mr. Staetter\u2019s written submissions and the respondents\u2019 submissions. For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal. [4] Mr. Staetter is 34 years old. His history of psychiatric involvement dates back to 2004 when, as a teenager, he was initially hospitalized and diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. According to the Review Board, his treatment has been complicated by substance abuse disorder (involving mainly cannabis) and his distrust of psychiatric medication. [5] Mr. Staetter\u2019s denial of his psychiatric condition and his need for treatment, combined with his persistent delusions that are resistant to treatment, has led the Review Board to regularly conclude that he continued to pose a risk to public safety. He has frequently exercised his right to bring appeals of the Review Board decisions, but he has not been successful. [6] For background, a brief review of Mr. Staetter\u2019s litigation history in this Court is as follows: a) Appeal from the Review Board\u2019s November 27, 2012, decision to detain Mr. Staetter at the Forensic Psychiatric Hospital (\u201cFPH\u201d) in Port Coquitlam, British Columbia, was dismissed: 2013 BCCA 307. b) In March 2013, Mr. Staetter\u2019s application for an extension of time to appeal the finding of NCRMD was dismissed: 2013 BCSC 821. Leave to appeal that decision in this Court was dismissed by Lowry J.A. (June 26, 2013, CA40770), and an application to vary Lowry J.A.\u2019s decision was dismissed for want of jurisdiction: 2014 BCCA 294. c) Appeals from the Review Board\u2019s subsequent annual review dispositions to detain Mr. Staetter for further 12\u2011month periods were dismissed: 2015 BCCA 63, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 36396 (10 September 2015); 2016 BCCA 167; 2017 BCCA 68, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 38128 (22 November 2018); 2018 BCCA 125; 2019 BCCA 40; 2019 BCCA 337; 2019 BCCA 410. [7] Over the years since 2012, the Review Board has made many decisions regarding Mr. Staetter\u2019s detention and, despite his resistance to treatment, has made attempts to reintegrate him into the community. Two of these attempts failed when Mr. Staetter\u2019s mental status deteriorated and he relapsed into substance abuse and showed disinhibited behavior and resistance to treatment. [8] A third attempt to reintroduce Mr. Staetter to living in the community was more successful. Because of this, the Review Board decided on August 5, 2020, that his risk could be managed in the community. On that date, the Review Board granted him a conditional discharge. Mr. Staetter objects to the conditions and sought an absolute discharge before the Review Board one year later. [9] On August 4, 2021, the Review Board held its annual review hearing, reviewing the conditional discharge made a year earlier. Although Mr. Staetter asked for an absolute discharge, it decided to continue the conditional discharge. This is the decision under appeal. [10] The conditions that Mr. Staetter is subject to are set out in the disposition order made August 13, 2021. In summary, although he is able to live in the community, he remains under reporting requirements and the direction and supervision of the Director of Adult Forensic Psychiatric Services (the \u201cDirector\u201d). This means he must report as required and if his condition deteriorates he may be required to return to the FPH. He is prohibited from acquiring or possessing any weapon or consuming any illicit substance such as non\u2011prescription drugs or alcohol, and his compliance with this may be monitored by urinalysis. He is also prohibited from having any direct or indirect contact with his victims or being found within a certain geographic range of Whistler, where the offences against those victims took place. [11] This disposition is reviewable within 12 months, pursuant to s. 672.81 of the Criminal Code . [12] In his written submissions on appeal, Mr. Staetter asks that this Court allow the appeal by substituting an absolute discharge, and, in addition, ordering a new trial of the underlying offences that led to him being found NCRMD. In his oral submissions, Mr. Staetter says that he will be content with a conditional discharge if this Court changes the conditions to allow for three things: that he not be required to take any psychiatric drugs, which he describes as poison and as giving him bad side effects; that he be allowed to use marijuana, which he describes as his medicine and also as part of his religion; and that he be allowed to go to Whistler because that is where his tattoo artist resides. In other words, the only condition remaining of the conditional discharge would essentially be that he have no contact with the victims. He would also remain under the authority of the Review Board. [13] Let me deal briefly with Mr. Staetter\u2019s request to appeal his NCRMD verdict from October 2012 and to seek a new trial: this request is not properly before this Court in this appeal from the Review Board decision. That relief cannot be granted and I will not address it further. [14] With respect to Mr. Staetter\u2019s appeal, the Supreme Court of Canada summarized the proper approach in R. v. Owen , 2003 SCC 33, as follows: 22 An individual who is found to have committed a criminal act or omission under the influence of a mental disorder is not acquitted. Rather, if it is concluded that the mental disorder impaired his or her capacity at the time of the offence to appreciate the nature and quality of what was done or omitted, or of knowing that it was wrong, he or she must be adjudged by the court to be \u201cnot criminally responsible [NCR] on account of mental disorder\u201d ( Cr. C. , ss. 16(1) and 672.34). 23 There is no presumption that an NCR individual is a danger to the safety of the public: Winko, supra , at para. 46. On the contrary, the Criminal Code requires that persons found NCR be granted an absolute discharge unless the court or a Review Board is able to conclude that the individual poses a significant risk to the safety of the public. Even when this risk is established, the disposition is to be \u201cthe least onerous and least restrictive to the accused\u201d consistent with the level of risk posed, i.e., ranging from detention \u201cin custody in a hospital\u201d to discharge \u201csubject to such conditions as the court or Review Board considers appropriate\u201d ( Cr. C. , s. 672.54). 24 The disposition of a Review Board is subject to appeal to the appellate courts based on \u201ca transcript of the proceedings and any other evidence that the court of appeal finds necessary to admit in the interests of justice\u201d ( Cr. C. , s. 672.73(1)). 25 It is of central importance to the constitutional validity of this statutory arrangement that the individual, who by definition did not at the time of the offence appreciate what he or she was doing, or that it was wrong, be confined only for reasons of public protection, not punishment ( Winko, supra , at paras. 41 and 71, and R. v. Swain , [1991] 1 S.C.R. 933 ). [15] Section 672.78(1) of the Criminal Code gives this Court the power to allow an appeal from a Review Board decision on three grounds: (a) the decision is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence; (b) it is based on a wrong decision on a question of law; or (c) there was a miscarriage of justice. [16] The only ground that is relevant to this appeal is s. 672.78(1)(a). For this ground, the standard of review is reasonableness. This Court should decline to intervene unless the Review Board decision was unreasonable in the sense of not being supported by reasons that can bear even a somewhat probing examination: Owen at para. 33. Appellate intervention is limited because the Review Board\u2019s assessment of the offender\u2019s possible dangerousness and the treatment necessary to manage that risk in the community requires specialized knowledge, and the courts generally do not have that expertise: Gibson v. British Columbia (Adult Forensic Psychiatric Services) , 2021 BCCA 210 at paras. 5\u20136. The task of this Court is to determine whether the Review Board reached an \u201cacceptable and defensible outcome\u201d: Gibson at para. 17, citing Nelson v. British Columbia (Adult Forensic Psychiatric Services) , 2017 BCCA 40 at para. 24. [17] The Review Board correctly stated that its task was to identify whether Mr. Staetter is a significant threat to public safety, in the sense that he poses a risk of serious physical or psychological harm to members of the public resulting from conduct that is criminal in nature but not necessarily violent. [18] There was evidence at the hearing from Mr. Staetter, and from his community treatment team, including his psychiatrist, Dr. Oswald, and case manager, Mr. Bekar. [19] The Review Board found that there had been no meaningful change in Mr. Staetter\u2019s mental status over the last year. The Review Board found that he continues to adhere to his entrenched delusions and remains without any insight into his circumstances. He adamantly insists that psychiatric medication is poison and has repeatedly asked for a reduction or discontinuation of his medication. The Review Board observed that Mr. Staetter repeatedly seeks a prescription for cannabis and believes use of this will create a utopian world. [20] The Review Board noted at paras. 11\u201314: [11] Dr. Oswald observed that the accused has continued to endorse an expansive and complex delusional system. This includes the belief of having an alter ego named \u201cEli\u201d and engaging in fantastic activities such as teleportation. The accused thinks that the victim has shape shifting abilities and has described having \u201ckilled\u201d her when she was a different male person. Dr. Oswald noted that in the past the accused has said that he is Jesus Christ and has described Whistler (the municipality where the victim resided) as \u201cNew Jerusalem.\u201d [12] Significantly, the accused continues to adhere to the delusions that motivated him to commit the index offences. He remains focused on overturning his NCRMD verdict, claiming that his trial was a mockery of justice, that the trial judge will receive her just desserts in the future, and that he was \u201cdenied a defence.\u201d The accused does not conceal that if absolutely discharged, his first action would be to contact the victim. [13] Notwithstanding the accused\u2019s overt symptomatology, he has remained behaviourally settled. He has continued to live at Johnson Manor without significant problem. He has worked part\u2011time as a dishwasher and remains interested in pursuing similar employment. Although it is unclear how the accused spends the majority of his day, as he has not been willing to share this information, there have been no reports or indication of untoward behaviours. [14] In oral evidence Dr. Oswald confirmed that the accused\u2019s risk was rooted in his elaborate delusional beliefs. He characterized these as worrisome. He reiterated that the accused has stated that if he were absolutely discharged, he would immediately contact the victim in order to exonerate himself. Dr. Oswald observed that the accused\u2019s delusions are not encapsulated and have continued to evolve and incorporate new material. He acknowledged that despite the accused\u2019s entrenched beliefs, he had demonstrated a capacity to conform his behaviour to the treatment team\u2019s expectations. He explained that the accused was strongly motivated to avoid further return to FPH. [21] The Review Board considered the evidence that Mr. Staetter has during the review period remained compliant with treatment and supervision, but, in Dr. Oswald\u2019s opinion, this was assisted by the medication and motivated only by Mr. Staetter\u2019s wish to avoid involuntary return to FPH (see paras. 9, 13, 14). Dr. Oswald stated in his report that, based on Mr. Staetter\u2019s history, if he discontinued treatment, \u201cthis would lead to significant mental deterioration with the development of expanded delusions\u201d. In that scenario, \u201cMr. Staetter\u2019s risk for violence, including criminal harassment, would be high.\u201d [22] The Review Board noted Dr. Oswald\u2019s opinion of Mr. Staetter\u2019s risk was that his most likely form of future violence would be harassment, although it was \u201cconceivable that Mr. Staetter\u2019s aggression could escalate to physical violence\u201d (at para. 23). [23] Mr. Bekar\u2019s evidence was consistent with Dr. Oswald\u2019s evidence. [24] Mr. Staetter testified that he was not psychotic and did not have delusions. He insisted that he did not have a fair trial and that he did not threaten P.H. His written submissions repeated many of his delusions. [25] The Review Board concluded that there was little doubt that if absolutely discharged without the conditions, Mr. Staetter would act upon his delusions and pose a real risk to P.H. and persons associated with her. Based on all of the circumstances, the Review Board concluded that Mr. Staetter remained a significant threat to public safety (at para. 24). [26] Concerning disposition, the Review Board noted that the Director and the Crown agreed that Mr. Staetter\u2019s risk was manageable under the conditions imposed on the conditional discharge. The Board noted that it is likely that the injectable psychiatric medication taken by Mr. Staetter has attenuated his beliefs enough so that he does not act on them. The Review Board found no merit to Mr. Staetter\u2019s request to delete all conditions except the no contact provisions (at para. 25), a request similar to the one made orally on this appeal. [27] Accordingly, the Review Board made a conditional discharge on the same conditions as the previous disposition. [28] In my view, the reasons of the Review Board show that it carefully considered all of the evidence before it and found the evidence to support the conclusion that Mr. Staetter remains resistant to treatment, psychotic and delusional, and that he poses a real risk to the victims and other members of the public unless he is managed in the community by way of the conditions placed on his discharge. [29] Mr. Staetter\u2019s main complaint appears to be directed towards the continued administration of psychiatric medication and the condition that he not take non\u2011prescription drugs such as marijuana. While he has not behaved dangerously over the past year, the Review Board considered Dr. Oswald\u2019s opinion that Mr. Staetter\u2019s adherence to treatment was only as a result of the deterrent effect of involuntary return to FPH if he discontinued treatment. [30] Although Mr. Staetter strongly opposes any conditions imposed on him, his evidence and submissions at the review hearing and his submissions on appeal, when viewed objectively, are consistent with Dr. Oswald\u2019s evidence. [31] The Review Board concluded that, if released, Mr. Staetter will likely discontinue the psychiatric medication that has helped him make progress in his treatment so far, and he would thereby pose a real risk to P.H. or other persons, and so imposed conditions on Mr. Staetter\u2019s discharge that were the least onerous and least restrictive disposition consistent with public safety. Applying the standard under the Criminal Code , I am of the view that the Review Board\u2019s decision is neither unreasonable nor unsupported by the evidence. [32] For these reasons, I am of the view there is no basis for interfering with the Review Board\u2019s decision. [33] I would dismiss the appeal. [34] SAUNDERS J.A. : I agree. [35] ABRIOUX J.A. : I agree. [36] SAUNDERS J.A. : The appeal is dismissed. \u201cThe Honourable Madam Justice Griffin\u201d",

        "text": "IN THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA Citation: Rizzuto v. Grover, 2021 BCSC 619 Date: 20210106 Docket: E54267 Registry: New Westminster Between: Garth Alexander Rizzuto Claimant And Susan Marie Grover Respondent Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice Ball Oral Reasons for Judgment In Chambers The Claimant, appearing on his own behalf via teleconference: G.A. Rizzuto Counsel for the Respondent appearing via teleconference: R.A. Henderson Place and Date of Hearing: New Westminster, B.C. January 6, 2021 Place and Date of Judgment: New Westminster, B.C. January 6, 2021 [1] THE COURT: This is an application which has been brought by the respondent, Susan Marie Grover, for an order that the claimant post the sum of $23,000.00 on account of security for costs for the respondent and to impose a time limit for the posting of security for costs. [2] This matter has a long history, but not much has happened. It is a long history in the sense that there has been some delay. Originally, the action was brought as a family law claim, but that matter was litigated before the Honourable Mr. Justice Harvey. The hearing was on March 6, 2020, and the judgment was ultimately rendered on October 23, 2020. At that time, having reviewed the affidavits of the parties as a summary trial matter, Mr. Justice Harvey ordered that the parties were not spouses as that is defined in the Family Law Act . As a result that portion of the claim had to fail. [3] The other issue which Mr. Justice Harvey dealt with related to the Certificates of Pending Litigation (\u201cCPL\u201d) that had been filed by the claimant against two properties called the \u201cCedar Bowl Crescent properties\u201d. The Cedar Bowl Crescent properties had been purchased with monies, from everything I can see in the material that is filed, that came exclusively from the respondent, based on the sale of her own property in Burnaby. Subsequently, using the proceeds of sale of the Burnaby property, she purchased the two Cedar Bowl Crescent properties, one of which had a home on it; the other property was empty land. [4] There are some complications, in that the company owned apparently by Mr. Rizzuto brought proceedings in the Small Claims Division and then abandoned certain parts of his claim for monies he said he spent on construction. There is great dispute and debate over that, as the respondent takes the position that she had to pay many bills twice. Those issues were not before the court on this application. [5] But, in any event, the reasons given by Mr. Justice Harvey, Rizzuto v. Grover , 2020 BCSC 1564, which are extensive, state at para. 114, as follows: Finally, I am not convinced of the strength of the claimant\u2019s argument for a property interest in the Cedar Bowl Crescent properties. I have considered the, albeit disputed, evidence tendered by the claimant supporting his claim for a constructive trust . . . Then the court goes on and says that Mr. Justice Harvey was not going to deal with the claim for constructive trust, but, at the same time, he ordered the removal of the CPLs from those two properties, the result being that the respondent was free to deal with them. [6] An issue that remained alive in this proceeding was a claim in trust. There was no document nor written agreement with respect to such a claim relating to either the purchase by Ms. Grover of the property with any of the vendors or any agreement with the claimant here. The claimant simply says \u201cI think we were in a trust relationship\". The claimant\u2019s thoughts are insufficient to found a claim in trust. [7] Speaking to the respondent\u2019s application for security for costs, Supreme Court Family Rule 22-1(6) provides the court a discretion to make an order for security for costs. In respect to an individual, that discretion is to be exercised carefully and with a high threshold, where security for costs are sought against an individual. [8] In this case, there is a claim in trust by the plaintiff, which is unsupported by any documentation and which claim has already been, in part, ruled against by Mr. Justice Harvey. The Court there made and expression of the lack of strength of the claimant's argument with respect to the Cedar Bowl Crescent properties. Harvey J. certainly was not satisfied it was a strong claim. [9] In those circumstances, this is a case which meets that high threshold. Counsel for the respondent provided a draft calculation of costs for a trial for five days, based on a matter of ordinary difficulty. The draft totals over $23,000.00. I am satisfied that the respondent is entitled to an order that the claimant post the sum of $23,000.00 on account of security for costs and that that sum shall be posted with the court within 60 days from today. The claimant will also have her costs of this hearing today. [10] The Court also orders that Mr. Rizzuto\u2019s signature may be dispensed with on the order herein on the agreement by counsel to provide him with a copy of the order as soon as it is entered. Thank you. \"Ball J.\u201d",

Rauch Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British Columbia January 8, 2020 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia January 9, 2020 Summary: Mr. Tallio re-applies for bail pending his appeal. Held: Application granted. The proposed release plan is sufficient to protect public safety. [1] BENNETT J.A. : Phillip Tallio brings his second application for judicial interim release pending appeal. For the reasons that follow, I would grant the application. [2] On August 9, 2019, I refused Mr. Tallio\u2019s first application in reasons indexed at 2019 BCCA 300. These reasons should be read in conjunction with those reasons. My main concern when I refused release was that the facility where he planned to reside could not provide sufficient supervision for him. [3] The Crown opposes his release. [4] This application is based on the John Howard Society accepting Mr. Tallio into one of its facilities. I have a complete affidavit, and heard evidence regarding the sufficiency of the supervision and programming available. I am satisfied that the John Howard Society will provide sufficient supervision of Mr. Tallio to protect the public safety. As a result, I am satisfied that the requirements for judicial interim release found in s. 679(3) of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C\u201146 have been met. In order to satisfy the public safety aspect of the public interest component, a number of conditions will be imposed as terms of his release. The conditions have generally been agreed to by the parties. [5] Thus, I order Mr. Tallio\u2019s release on a recognizance in the amount of $10,000 without deposit or surety with the following conditions: a) You must keep the peace and be of good behaviour. b) You must report to a bail supervisor no later than January 10, 2020 at Abbotsford Community Corrections at 2865 Cruickshank Street, Abbotsford, British Columbia, and thereafter once per week in person, or otherwise as directed by your bail supervisor. c) You must reside at [residence name and address redacted], Abbotsford, British Columbia. You must abide by all of the rules and regulations required by [the residence]. If you are expelled from [the residence], or no longer reside there for any reason, you will surrender forthwith into police custody. d) You are to go directly to [the residence] upon your release, in the company of your lawyer, a John Howard Society staff member or a Correctional Service of Canada employee. e) You shall not leave the Province of British Columbia. f) You will notify your bail supervisor and seek their permission before participating in any volunteer activity or obtaining employment. If you are granted permission by the bail supervisor to volunteer or work, you will provide a copy of this release document to a supervisor of the volunteer organization and/or your employer. You will immediately notify your bail supervisor if you are no longer volunteering or employed. g) You shall have no contact directly or indirectly, including by social media, with Marion Bolton or her family known to you, nor with Blair Mack or his family known to you, except through legal counsel. h) You are not to be in the presence of any person under the age of 16 years, unless accompanied by or in the presence of an adult at all times. You will not attend any public swimming area, community centre, daycare centre, school ground or playground where persons under the age of 16 years are present or can reasonably be expected to be present, except with the written permission of your bail supervisor, which you will carry with you. i) You must not go to Bella Coola, Bella Bella or Hagensborg, British Columbia. j) You must not consume alcohol or any illegal substances. k) You must not be in possession of any weapons, including knives, except for the preparation of or eating food, or for the purposes directly related to your employment. l) You shall obey the following curfew by being in the residence, which includes the exterior property of the residence, except for medical emergencies, or with the bail supervisor\u2019s written permission which must be carried with you: i. between the hours of 12:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. for the first thirty days of your release; ii. between the hours of 2:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. for the next thirty days of your release; iii. between the hours of 4:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. for the next thirty days of your release; and iv. after the first 90 days of your release, between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. m) You must present yourself at the door of the above-noted residence when asked by a bail supervisor or peace officer. n) You must comply with the reporting requirements of [the residence], and report as and when directed to them, and by them. o) You must carry a copy of this release document with you at all times when outside your residence. p) You must have meetings as directed by [the residence] staff to ensure the progress and development of a Resident Action Plan and counselling program. q) Having consented, you shall continue to receive trauma counselling from Sandra Dykstra, which is funded through Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, or you shall work with [the residence] to locate and utilize a different counsellor if Ms. Dykstra is unable to provide continued counselling services. r) You shall not travel into the City of Vancouver, British Columbia unless accompanied by a John Howard Society staff member, or other person approved by your bail supervisor in writing, which you will carry with you, or with your counsel. s) You shall surrender into custody at 9:00 a.m. on March 30, 2020 to the Sheriff\u2019s office at the Law Courts at 800 Smithe Street, Vancouver, British Columbia. \u201cThe Honourable Madam Justice Bennett\u201d",

Stevic, 2022 BCCA 45 Date: 20220131 Docket: CA47544 Between: Regina Respondent And Jugoslav Stevic Appellant Before: The Honourable Madam Justice Bennett The Honourable Madam Justice Stromberg\u2011Stein The Honourable Madam Justice Fisher On appeal from: An order of the Provincial Court of British Columbia, dated May 13, 2021 (sentence) ( R. v. Stevic , Vancouver Docket 256892\u20111). Oral Reasons for Judgment The Appellant, appearing in person (via videoconference): J. Stevic Counsel for the Respondent (via videoconference): L.A. Chu Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British Columbia January 31, 2022 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia January 31, 2022 Summary: Appeal from a sentence of fines and a restitution order for fraud and uttering a forged document following a joint submission. Held: Appeal dismissed. Appellate intervention is not justified in this case. The appellant has not demonstrated the sentence was demonstrably unfit or the judge committed an error of principle that impacted the sentence by failing to make an in\u2011depth inquiry into his ability to pay in the face of a joint submission on sentencing. STROMBERG-STEIN J.A. : [1] Jugoslav Stevic appeals his sentence of a fine and a restitution order following his guilty pleas to fraud and uttering a forged document. Notwithstanding the sentence was a joint submission by Crown and defence counsel, he submits the sentence was excessive because the judge did not consider his ability to pay. For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal. [2] Mr. Stevic is 61 years old. He has health problems. In 2011, he began to receive provincial disability assistance of approximately $1,450.50 per month. He was employed as a school bus driver. [3] In 2016, Mr. Stevic was involved in a car accident. He applied for temporary total disability (TTD) benefits, which are payable to individuals rendered incapable of working as a result of accident injuries. He received approximately $300 per week from April 13, 2016, to October 1, 2018, from the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC). Mr. Stevic was not entitled to a large portion of these benefits as he continued working as a bus driver during most of this period of time, and he was on seasonal layoff when school was not in session. [4] To facilitate his fraudulent receipt of TTD benefits, Mr. Stevic forged a company signature on a certificate of earnings. [5] He has been unemployed since September 2018, and claims he has no other income or savings. However, when an ICBC investigator interviewed Mr. Stevic on October 1, 2018, he offered to give the money back to ICBC. He has no other criminal record. [6] On February 10, 2021, Mr. Stevic entered guilty pleas on two counts: fraud over $5,000 and uttering a forged document. Pursuant to s. 738(1) of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C\u201146, the Crown sought a restitution order in the amount of $14,414.28. This amount was disputed. [7] On May 13, 2021, there was a Gardiner hearing to determine the amount of the fraud. An ICBC representative and Mr. Stevic testified. However, over the lunch break, Crown and defence counsel reached an agreement for a joint submission on sentence, which included restitution in the amount of $12,000 and a fine of $3,500, split between the two counts. [8] The judge\u2019s reasons are sparse. He declined to hear submissions on Mr. Stevic\u2019s antecedents, indicating it was his practice to follow a joint submission \u201cunless there is some good reason not to do so.\u201d He also commented that the lawyers were experienced. [9] When defence counsel said he doubted Mr. Stevic could pay the victim surcharge, the judge waived it. When the judge asked Mr. Stevic if he wanted one year to pay the fine, Mr. Stevic answered in the affirmative and added something, which is indicated as inaudible in the transcript. To this, the judge replied, \u201c[i]t sounds like you are going to be struggling a wee bit.\u201d In asking for as much time to pay as the court was willing to give, defence counsel explained Mr. Stevic was unemployed and was probably going to remain so for the foreseeable future. The judge granted Mr. Stevic one year, to May 31, 2022, to pay the fine. He explained that if Mr. Stevic could not pay the fine, and it posed a hardship, Mr. Stevic could apply for an extension of time to pay. The judge informed Mr. Stevic he could face a further charge, potentially resulting in a jail sentence, if he did not pay the fine and did not seek an extension. The judge was satisfied Mr. Stevic acknowledged the terms and conditions of the fine. [10] With respect to the restitution order, the judge erroneously told Mr. Stevic that if he did not pay, there was a potential for a jail sentence. However, in my view, nothing turns on this. [11] The standard of appellate review on sentence appeals is highly deferential. Intervention is justified when an appellate court identifies a material error in principle that has impacted the sentence or the sentence is demonstrably unfit. A demonstrably unfit sentence is a sentence that is \u201cclearly unreasonable\u201d, \u201cclearly or manifestly excessive\u201d, or one that represents a \u201csubstantial and marked departure\u201d from typical sentences. Where intervention is justified, an appellate court will perform its own sentencing analysis, showing deference to the judge\u2019s findings that are untainted by error: R. v. Lacasse, 2015 SCC 64 at paras. 41\u201344, 52\u201353; R. v. Friesen, 2020 SCC 9 at paras. 25\u201329. Restitution orders are subject to the same standard of appellate review: R. v. Dunkers, 2018 BCCA 363 at para. 14. [12] Mr. Stevic appeals his sentence on the basis that it is excessive. I assume he means the sentence is demonstrably unfit. He also seems to allege an error in principle. His factum appears to focus on the fine, but the remedy Mr. Stevic seeks is a \u201creassessment of the fine and restitution amounts\u201d because the judge erred in failing to properly apply s. 734(2) of the Criminal Code by not satisfying himself Mr. Stevic could pay. [13] There are a number of overlapping areas of the law at play in this case. Judges are not bound to accept joint submissions, but the test for departing from a joint submission is high: \u201cwhether the proposed sentence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute, or would otherwise be contrary to the public interest\u201d: R. v. Anthony\u2011Cook , 2016 SCC 43 at para. 5. Judges are presumed to know the law, so in this case, the judge\u2019s comment\u2014that his practice was to accept joint submissions \u201cunless there is some good reason not to do so\u201d\u2014is presumed to mean he considered the public interest test in Anthony\u2011Cook . [14] A judge cannot impose a fine unless satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, the accused is able to pay. Section 734(2) of the Criminal Code provides: Except when the punishment for an offence includes a minimum fine or a fine is imposed in lieu of a forfeiture order, a court may fine an offender under this section only if the court is satisfied that the offender is able to pay the fine or discharge it under section 736. [15] A judge must make an affirmative finding based on proper evidence: R. v. Topp , 2011 SCC 43 at paras. 21, 24. However, in line with the reasoning in Anthony\u2011Cook , in my view, the sentencing judge is entitled to rely on the joint submission of counsel when considering the accused\u2019s ability to pay. [16] Where there is past receipt of illegally obtained funds, a judge may infer the accused has the ability to pay a fine in the absence of a reasonable explanation that they no longer possess their ill\u2011gotten gains: Topp at para. 7. A judge may also make this inference if they have sufficient financial information, obtain the assurance of counsel, or consider the conduct of the accused: R. v. S.W.M. , 2010 BCCA 86 at para. 20; R. v. United States of America (2004), 71 O.R. (3d) 141 at para. 37, 184 C.C.C. (3d) 427 (S.C.); R. v. Shin , 2015 ONCA 189 at paras. 108\u2013128. [17] On appeal, Mr. Stevic claims he is unable to pay the fine. He submits he had little time over the lunch hour to consider the joint submission, even though he agreed to it in court. In particular, Mr. Stevic suggests the judge committed a reversible error by failing to sufficiently inquire into Mr. Stevic\u2019s financial circumstances to determine his ability to pay the fine prior to imposing the sentence. Had the judge done so, he would have realized Mr. Stevic did not have sufficient means to pay the fine and should then have exercised his discretion to refuse to accept the joint submission. Moreover, Mr. Stevic asserts the judge should have realized this inquiry was necessary because he acknowledged Mr. Stevic would struggle to pay the fine, granted him a year to pay, and noted Mr. Stevic could apply for an extension. [18] I would not accede to the arguments of Mr. Stevic. I would note Mr. Stevic does not say his financial position has changed since the fine was imposed. Nor has he applied to extend the time to pay his fine or made any effort to pay anything toward the fine. He was represented by counsel at the hearing. He agreed to the joint submission in court. In the circumstances, the judge was not required to make a specific inquiry about Mr. Stevic\u2019s ability to pay. Rather, the judge was entitled to rely on the joint submission and the assurance of experienced counsel to infer that Mr. Stevic was willing and able to pay the fine. [19] Restitution orders are not subject to s. 734(2): Topp at para. 38. Nonetheless, while the accused\u2019s ability to pay restitution is not a precondition to making a restitution order, it is an important factor a judge must weigh and consider, and not merely note: R. v. Robertson , 2020 ONCA 367 at para. 8; R. v. Sawchuk , 2021 BCCA 74 at para. 16; R. v. Abdulahi\u2011Sabet , 2020 BCCA 213 at para. 13. [20] However, where the offence involves a breach of trust, or is theft \u2011 related and stolen money is unaccounted for, the accused\u2019s ability to pay is given little weight. The inverse is also true. In these circumstances, it is important to account for what happened to the money: Abdulahi\u2011Sabet at paras. 14\u201315. [21] A restitution order should be made with restraint and caution, should bear in mind the principle of totality, and should not be a mechanical afterthought: Abdulahi\u2011Sabet at para. 12. [22] In this case, given the fact that the fruits of the fraud have not been accounted for and the evidence before the judge on the joint submission, the judge\u2019s stand\u2011alone restitution order was entirely appropriate. Mr. Stevic\u2019s ability to pay was (and is) not entitled to much weight in the circumstances. Further, it is clear the judge considered the joint submission and he did not simply add a restitution order as a mechanical afterthought. The restitution order is enforceable as a civil judgment, with no prescribed time to pay. [23] Mr. Stevic agreed to pay the fine and he agreed to the restitution order. He told the ICBC investigator he was willing to pay the money back. The money remains unaccounted for. [24] Appellate intervention is not justified in this case. Mr. Stevic has not met the high threshold of demonstrating the sentence imposed was demonstrably unfit. Nor has he shown the judge committed an error of principle that impacted the sentence by failing to make an in\u2011depth inquiry into his ability to pay in the face of a joint submission on sentencing. [25] I would note that even for a first\u2011time offender, in my view, Mr. Stevic\u2019s sentence could be considered lenient. The relevant principles of sentencing are denunciation and deterrence for fraud offences. The circumstances of this case could easily have attracted a custodial sentence of several months: R. v. Kodimyala , 2020 BCCA 275. [26] I would grant leave to appeal, but would dismiss the appeal. [27] BENNETT J.A. : I agree. [28] FISHER J.A. : I agree. [29] BENNETT J.A. : Leave to appeal is granted, but the appeal is dismissed. \u201cThe Honourable Madam Justice Stromberg\u2011Stein\u201d",

        "text": "IN THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA Citation: R. v. Smith, 2019 BCSC 1152 Date: 20190111 Docket: X079843 Registry: New Westminster Regina v. Stephen Smith Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice Riley Oral Ruling re Application for Additional Information (Re: Accused Stephen Smith) Counsel for the Crown: S.D. Smith C. Karlsson Counsel for the Accused Smith: M.J. Swartz Place and Date of Hearing: New Westminster, B.C. January 11, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: New Westminster, B.C. January 11, 2019 [1] THE COURT: We are in the midst of the Crown's reply submissions at Mr. Smith's sentencing. In the course of the reply submissions, counsel for Mr. Smith has made a request for the court to seek out or obtain additional information in a number of areas. Counsel has suggested that this could be done either by ordering a further presentence report, with a direction that certain matters be included or addressed in the report, or by granting an adjournment to allow Mr. Smith to obtain the information in question, or finally, in the alternative, by the court, on its own motion, directing the production of additional material under s. 723(3) of the Criminal Code , R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 [ Code ]. [2] The information in question which drives the defence request falls into, really, two categories: One category is further details, biographical details about Mr. Smith's personal history, and in particular, the history of his time spent in the care of government ministries in Ontario, and the amount of time that he spent in Jamaica with extended family. The second category of information would be information pertaining to systemic racism and discrimination against black people in Canada, and how that might have a bearing upon Mr. Smith's circumstances in this case. [3] I have carefully considered Mr. Smith's proposal to obtain this additional information, but in my view, at this stage in the proceedings, such an approach is not required or warranted. I will point out that earlier in these proceedings, the court had indicated on a number of occasions that the sentencing proceeding would unfold, or the sentencing hearing would unfold in the following way: both parties would be expected to present any evidence they were relying upon, and after that stage of the hearing concluded, each party would then make its arguments about the appropriate disposition, based on the evidence that was adduced, or the facts that were presented. [4] In this context, a presentence report was prepared and made available for the sentencing, and filed as an exhibit at the sentencing hearing. There is a particular portion of that presentence report to which the Crown objected; that portion of the report contains Mr. Smith's recount of the circumstances of the offence, and more specifically, of his involvement in the offence. The Crown objected to that, and it was common ground that because the Crown objected to it, it was inadmissible. Mr. Smith then sought a ruling from the court allowing him to give evidence about that subject matter, and the court, after hearing extensive argument, ruled in Mr. Smith's favour, that he would be allowed to give evidence about his specific role in the offence. Ultimately, Mr. Smith made a decision not to do so, not to give evidence about his role in the offence, and that was the end of that matter. [5] The sentencing hearing proceeded. The Crown presented all of its evidence at sentencing, which included some material about Mr. Smith's background, and more specifically, about his time in custody, and his conduct while in custody. The defence also presented evidence at the sentencing hearing, most specifically, Mr. Smith himself testified, and addressed some of the material that had been filed by the Crown with respect to his conduct while in custody. Mr. Smith also gave further information about his upbringing and his background, and his time in the care of government ministries in Ontario. Mr. Smith was also cross-examined on his testimony. [6] After all of that evidence was placed before the court, the evidentiary portion of the sentencing hearing concluded, and we began submissions. [7] In the course of the Crown's submissions, the Crown, effectively, took the following positions with respect to the two categories of information. [8] First, with respect to the biographical information, the information about Mr. Smith's background, and, in particular, the information in the presentence report, the Crown did not take issue with the admissibility of Mr. Smith's statements in the presentence report, but the Crown did argue that the information in the presentence report was vague, and the court should take that into account in assessing the weight or the quality of the information in the report, insofar as it emanated from Mr. Smith. [9] With respect to the issue of racial discrimination in Canada, and, in particular, its significance in Mr. Smith's case, the Crown has said in submissions this afternoon, that the Crown is not disputing Mr. Smith's testimony with regard to his personal experience and his perceptions of the discrimination that he has been subjected to. The Crown's focus, in its argument, is on the extent to which that background is related to, or linked to the offences for which he is now being sentenced. [10] At the end of the day, there has to be some finality, and some end to the evidentiary inquiry for the purposes of sentencing. Both parties made decisions about what evidence they would present, and were accorded fair notice of what was in issue, and what was disputed, and what was not disputed. The Crown's position about the quality of the biographical information, and the extent of detail of the biographical information in the report, and about the relevance of racial discrimination, and how those issues relate to the sentencing in Mr. Smith's case, would not have been really a surprise to Mr. Smith. It is not a question of saying that the evidence presented by Mr. Smith was objected to as being inadmissible; it is a question of the Crown arguing what weight the court should attach to it, which is a function of argument, and would always be permitted. [11] In the end, I am not satisfied that it would be of real benefit to the court to adjourn the proceedings and occasion further delay in the conclusion of this case, in order to get more information, when each party had the opportunity to present the information earlier in the proceedings, and when the court now has a fair bit of information, including testimony from Mr. Smith himself about the two issues in question. In the end, I am not going to accede to Mr. Smith's request to order a further presentence report, or to adjourn to obtain more information, or to direct the production of additional material with respect to the matters that he has referred to in his request. \u201cRiley J.\u201d",

        "text": "COURT OF APPEAL OF YUKON Citation: R. v. Larue, 2020 YKCA 1 Date: 20200127 Docket: 13-YU727 Between: Regina Respondent And Norman Eli Larue Appellant Before: The Honourable Madam Justice Bennett The Honourable Madam Justice Dickson The Honourable Madam Justice Charbonneau Reasons for Judgment on the application made in writing to re-open the appeal. The Appellant, acting on his own behalf: (written submissions): N.E. Larue Counsel for the Respondent: N. Sinclair Written Submissions Received: December 20, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia January 27, 2020 Written Reasons of the Court Summary: Application to re-open appeal. Held: Dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Reasons for Judgment of the Court: [1] Norman Larue was convicted of first degree murder on July 3, 2013. His appeal to this Court was dismissed on June 13, 2018. The reasons are indexed at 2018 YKCA 9. The formal order was entered on August 22, 2018. His appeal to the SCC was dismissed on April 25, 2019. [2] He has filed an application in writing seeking to have his appeal in this Court re-opened, and wishes to raise grounds of appeal that were not argued in the first appeal. [3] Mr. Larue filed a similar application for a rehearing with the Supreme Court of Canada, which was dismissed on October 1, 2019. [4] He notified the registry in Yukon that he has additional material to file, however, given our decision on the jurisdictional point, we have concluded that there is nothing further to be considered that would alter the outcome. [5] In our view this Court does not have jurisdiction to re-open the appeal. For the reasons that follow, we would refuse the application. [6] If an appeal has been determined on its merits and the order has been entered, the Court is functus officio : R. v. Garcha , 2000 BCCA 550 at para. 9; R. v. Hummel , 2003 YKCA 4 at para. 15; R. v. Purdy , 2010 BCCA 413. Appellate courts across Canada are unified in this regard: see, for example R. v. H. (E.F.) (1997), 115 C.C.C. (3d) 89 (Ont. C.A.) at para. 33 [ Rhingo ]; R. v. Akinbiyi , 2008 SKCA 92 at para. 9; R. c. Balafrej (2005), 197 C.C.C. (3d) 88 (Que. C.A.) at paras. 25\u201327. [7] The reason the Court of Appeal lacks jurisdiction to entertain a re-hearing flows from the exceptional nature of an appeal as a creature of statute. In criminal cases, appeal rights exist by virtue of statutory authority only\u2014an appellate tribunal has no inherent or ancillary jurisdiction to hear a criminal appeal. [8] In exceptional circumstances, this Court has jurisdiction to entertain a request to re-open an appeal when the formal order has not yet been entered. Such an extraordinary power is to be exercised rarely, and only if the applicant can demonstrate a clear and compelling case that a miscarriage of justice will result if the proposed arguments are not considered: Hummel at para. 29. However, that is not the case here. As noted, the order was entered. [9] There are sound policy reasons supporting the reticence towards re-opening appeals that have already been heard on the merits. In Rhingo , Charron J.A. (as she then was) had this to say: 34 \u2026An unlimited discretion to reopen appeals that have been heard on their merits is not only unjustifiable as an ancillary power of the court, but would do significant harm to the criminal justice system. Finality is an important goal of the criminal process. Statutory rights of appeal provide a carefully crafted exception to the general rule that trial decisions are final. By providing broad fights of appellate review in criminal matters, Parliament recognizes that fairness and justice interests require that the accused have a full opportunity to challenge a conviction even though that opportunity will prolong the process. Once those broad appellate rights have been exercised and the merits of the appeal decided, then absent an appeal to a higher court, finality concerns must become paramount. Those affected by the process should be entitled to rely on the appellate decision and conduct themselves accordingly. The appellate process cannot become or even appear to become a never closing revolving door through with appellants come and go whenever they propose to argue a new ground of appeal. [Emphasis added.] [10] Mr. Larue was convicted of first degree murder, which is an indictable offence. Sections 675(1) and 691(1) of the Criminal Code provide an accused\u2019s substantive rights of appeal against a conviction in proceedings by indictment. However, s. 674 explicitly limits appeal rights in relation to indictable offences to the parameters set out in Parts XXI and XXVI: No proceedings other than those authorized by this Part and Part XXVI shall be taken by way of appeal in proceedings in respect of indictable offences. [11] Accordingly, once Mr. Larue\u2019s conviction appeal was dismissed on its merits and an order was entered, his statutory rights in this Court became exhausted. Any remaining appeal rights anchored in the Criminal Code were extinguished when the Supreme Court of Canada pronounced judgment on April 25, 2019. In effect, a subsequent \u201creopening of the same proceeding would involve the creation of further substantive or procedural rights, which only Parliament can enact\u201d: Rhingo at para. 33. [12] Mr. Larue may nonetheless apply for Ministerial review under Part XXI.1 of the Criminal Code . These provisions allow for an application to be made to the Minister of Justice for a review of the case on the basis of a miscarriage of justice, once a person\u2019s appeal rights have been exhausted. Mr. Larue\u2019s letter indicates that he has in fact initiated this process. [13] The application is refused. \u201cThe Honourable Madam Justice Bennett\u201d \u201cThe Honourable Madam Justice Dickson\u201d \u201cThe Honourable Madam Justice Charbonneau\u201d",

This publication ban applies indefinitely unless otherwise ordered. Restriction on publication: Pursuant to s. 16(4) of the Sex Offender Information and Registration Act [ SOIRA ], no person shall disclose any information that is collected pursuant to an order under SOIRA or the fact that information relating to a person is collected under SOIRA . Before: The Honourable Madam Justice Saunders (In Chambers) On appeal from: An order of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, dated May 16, 2018 ( R. v. Czechowski , 2018 BCSC 1646 , Kelowna Docket 84432-2 ). Oral Reasons for Judgment Counsel for the Appellant (via teleconference): M.A. Nathanson Counsel for the Respondent (via teleconference): M. Vojvodic Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British Columbia January 4, 2021 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia January 8, 2021 Summary: Application for bail pending disposition of the applicant\u2019s application for leave to appeal from conviction to the Supreme Court of Canada. The application is opposed by the Crown on the basis the applicant has not established that his detention is not necessary in the public interest (s. 679(3)(c) of the Criminal Code). The proposed grounds of appeal relate to this court\u2019s application of the curative proviso in s. 686(1(b)(iii) where two serious errors of law have been identified. Held: Application allowed on terms. The components of the s. 679(3)(c) criterion are public safety and public confidence in the administration of justice. The public confidence component balances enforceability versus reviewability. Given the degree of arguability of the proposed grounds of appeal and their possible national import, the proposed leave to appeal application has sufficient potential to weigh in favour of release. That potential, combined with the ability of strict terms of release to address public safety issues and the character of the proposed appeal as an initial review of the issues raised, favours release pending determination of the leave application. [1] SAUNDERS J.A. : Mr. Czechowski applies pursuant to s. 679(1)(c) of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C\u201146 for judicial interim release (bail) pending his s. 691 application for leave to appeal his convictions to the Supreme Court of Canada. He was convicted at trial by judge alone on May 16, 2018 of four offences arising from a sexual encounter between himself and the complainant in February 2016: sexual assault causing bodily harm, unlawful confinement, attempting to choke or suffocate or strangle, and uttering threats. On April 5, 2019, he was sentenced on these offences to five years\u2019 incarceration, in total. [2] The applicant appealed his convictions to this court. Pending his appeal, he was given judicial interim release, as he had between the time of his conviction and sentencing, and indeed time before his conviction. In August 2020, while this court\u2019s decision on his conviction appeals was reserved, the Crown applied to revoke his bail because he had been charged with uttering threats in an unrelated incident. Mr. Justice Butler dismissed that application in reasons indexed at 2020 BCCA 237, but imposed more restrictive terms of release. [3] The applicant\u2019s conviction appeal was dismissed on October 13, 2020, by reasons indexed as 2020 BCCA 277. [4] The issues at trial related to consent in respect of sexual activity between the applicant and the complainant. The judge accepted the complainant\u2019s testimony that she had not consented to any of the sexual activity and found, in the alternative, that she had no capacity to consent in any event. In so finding, the judge relied upon expert evidence from a medical doctor about the complainant\u2019s memory and referred to the doctor\u2019s evidence of a prior consistent statement made by the complainant at the hospital. The trial record included a body of evidence of physical injuries sustained by the complainant in the encounter, and words said by her in communications between the police and the complainant shortly after she left the residence. [5] Before this court, the applicant raised seven grounds of appeal. This court found that the trial judge had made two serious errors of law, the first in admitting and relying on expert evidence from a physician that went beyond the physician\u2019s expertise, and the second in considering the complainant\u2019s prior consistent statement to the physician. This court then considered the application of the curative proviso under s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code in the circumstances of the two errors of law identified. This court held that evidence of the injuries to the complainant, the doctor\u2019s assessment of the injuries, and the complainant\u2019s interactions with police immediately after the incident were inconsistent with consensual sex and in conclusion found that circumstantial evidence against the applicant \u201coverwhelmingly established non\u2011consent\u201d apart from the complainant\u2019s testimony. It dismissed the appeal on the basis conviction would be inevitable upon a retrial. [6] In his application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, the applicant contends that this court has \u201cwatered down\u201d the standard applicable in application of the curative proviso, contrary to jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of Canada such as R. v. Sarrazin , 2011 SCC 54 and R. v. Van , 2009 SCC 22. [7] He says that this court selectively looked to evidence that supported the Crown\u2019s case and ignored evidence capable of raising a reasonable doubt, diminishing the high standard for application of the curative proviso and he refers to jurisprudence from other provinces that he says has rejected the use of the proviso in similar circumstances. Further, the applicant contends that this court reversed the onus of proof, contrary to ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter and that the results violate his right to a jury trial under s. 11(h) of the Charter . [8] Section 679(3) sets out the criteria that must be established by an applicant to obtain judicial interim release: (3) In the case of an appeal referred to in paragraph (1)(a) or (c), the judge of the court of appeal may order that the appellant be released pending the determination of his appeal if the appellant establishes that (a) the appeal or application for leave to appeal is not frivolous; (b) he will surrender himself into custody in accordance with the terms of the order; and (c) his detention is not necessary in the public interest. [9] Each of these three criteria must be met on a balance of probabilities: R. v. Oland , 2017 SCC 17 at para. 17. [10] On this application, the applicant says that he has met all three criteria. [11] The Crown agrees that the applicant has met the first two criteria, but says that the applicant has not established that his detention is not necessary in the public interest. In particular on the third criterion, the Crown says that application for leave to appeal is fundamentally flawed because it seeks to undermine jurisprudence from the Supreme Court of Canada wherein the curative proviso has been applied to sustain convictions based on a subset of the evidence adduced at trial, and that the applicant has not raised any issues of national importance. [12] I will address the three criteria separately \u2013 the first two in short compass. [13] It is accepted that the merits assessment of the first criterion, whether the application is frivolous, is a low bar. On a leave application the merits will include consideration of whether the proposed appeal could be of national importance: R. v. Pires , 2004 BCCA 91. This is in the context, however, of the low bar. [14] In light of the low bar and the articulated proposed grounds of appeal, I am satisfied that the applicant has met this first criterion. [15] The second criterion engages the likelihood that the applicant will surrender himself into custody in accordance with the terms of the order. I agree that on the materials before us, there is ample evidence to satisfy this criterion. [16] The real question before me is whether the applicant has satisfied the third criterion: has he established that his detention while he awaits the decision in his leave application is not necessary in the public interest. [17] There are two components to the third criterion, public safety and public confidence in the administration of justice: Oland at para. 23. The Crown says that the public safety consideration weighs against release because he has been charged with uttering threats that necessitated a further tightening of his bail conditions before this court dismissed his conviction appeal. [18] I recognize this concern but note that the charge of uttering threats is still in early stages of the trial process, and Justice Butler considered the tightened bail conditions sufficiently met the public safety risk that charge indicated. There is no evidence of a failure to meet the tightened conditions. While this feature is troubling, in light of the history in this court on the prior applications I cannot say, by itself, it is determinative. [19] This application therefore comes down to a question of public confidence in the administration of justice. In Oland , the Supreme Court of Canada said, at para. 47, concerning public confidence: [47] ... is to be measured through the eyes of a reasonable member of the public. This person is someone who is thoughtful, dispassionate, informed of the circumstances of the case and respectful of society\u2019s fundamental values. [20] The question of public confidence in turn engages two competing interests which must be balanced, the enforceability interest and the reviewability interest. [21] In R. v. Boima , unreported, (5 November 2018), Vancouver CA44501 (B.C.C.A.), Madam Justice Dickson described enforceability and reviewability in these terms: [21] Enforceability relates to the public interest in the enforcement of judgments and in denying bail to a person convicted of a serious offence. It captures the gravity of the offence, the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence and the potential length of imprisonment: Oland at para. 38. The fact that an appellate court upheld a guilty verdict means that the pendulum swings towards enforceability and away from bail pending further review: R. v. Drabinsky , 201 1 ONCA 647 at para. 10 (Doherty J.A. in Chambers). [22] Reviewability relates to the public interest in the review and correction of errors in judgments: R. v. Mapara , 2001 BCCA 508 at para. 32. In the appellate context, the strength of the case factor translates into the strength of the grounds of appeal and informs reviewability: Oland at para. 40. Using their experience and knowledge, judges should form a preliminary assessment of the strength of the grounds of appeal to see if they \"clearly surpass the not frivolous standard\": Oland at paras. 44\u201345. [22] In respect of enforceability, the Supreme Court of Canada in Oland said: [37] In assessing whether public confidence concerns support a pre-trial detention order under s. 515(10)(c), the seriousness of the crime plays an important role. The more serious the crime, the greater the risk that public confidence in the administration of justice will be undermined if the accused is released on bail pending trial. So too for bail pending appeal. In considering the public confidence component under s. 679(3)(c), I see no reason why the seriousness of the crime for which a person has been convicted should not play an equal role in assessing the enforceability interest . [38] With that in mind, I return to s. 515(10)(c), where Parliament has set out three factors by which the seriousness of a crime may be determined: the gravity of the offence, the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence, and the potential length of imprisonment (s. 515(10)(c)(ii), (iii) and (iv)). In my view, these factors are readily transferable to s. 679(3)(c) \u2014 the only difference being that, unlike the pre-trial context, an appeal judge will generally have the trial judge\u2019s reasons for sentence in which the three factors going to the seriousness of the crime will have been addressed. As a rule, the appeal judge need not repeat this exercise . [39] I pause here to note that while the seriousness of the crime for which the offender has been convicted will play an important role in assessing the enforceability interest, other factors should also be taken into account where appropriate. For example, public safety concerns that fall short of the substantial risk mark \u2014 which would preclude a release order \u2014 will remain relevant under the public confidence component and can, in some cases, tip the scale in favour of detention: R. v. Rhyason , 2006 ABCA 120, 208 C.C.C. (3d) 193, at para. 15; R. v. Roussin , 2011 MBCA 103, 275 Man. R. (2d) 46, at para. 34. The same holds true for lingering flight risks that do not rise to the substantial risk level under s. 679(3)(b). By the same token, the absence of flight or public safety risks will attenuate the enforceability interest. [Emphasis added.] [23] In respect of the reviewability interest, the strength of the appeal or application for leave to appeal is important, beyond the \u201cnot frivolous\u201d standard of the first criterion in s. 679(3): see Oland at para. 44; R. v. Porisky , 2012 BCCA 467; R. v. Mapara , 2001 BCCA 508. Here also the level of the legal proceedings is significant. [24] In Drabinsky , Justice Doherty considered an application for judicial interim release of an applicant sentenced to five years\u2019 incarceration on two counts of fraud who had applied to the Supreme Court of Canada for leave to appeal from conviction. All grounds of appeal had been rejected by the appellate court. In dismissing the application for judicial interim release, Justice Doherty gave priority to the enforceability interest in recognition that the grounds of appeal advanced had already been reviewed and rejected on appeal and there was no further right to an appeal. Last, he considered that the length of sentence in that case meant that there would still be a large remainder of the sentence to be served after the leave application was determined. [25] A different result obtained in Boima . In Boima , Madam Justice Dickson observed that the applicant\u2019s application for leave to appeal amounted to an attempt \u201cto push beyond the current boundaries of the law\u201d. She then observed that sometimes boundaries are pushed successfully, and that the length of sentence imposed in the case before her meant that almost all of the sentence would have been served before the leave application would be known. This latter factor weighed strongly in her view that, combined with the absence of a flight risk and the absence of a concern for public safety, the reviewability interest outweighed the enforceability interest. [26] The case before me is between the circumstances of Boima and those of Drabinsky . Unlike Boima , the applicant will not have served all or nearly all of the sentence by the time the leave application is decided. And unlike Drabinsky , not all of the applicant\u2019s grounds of appeal were rejected by this court. Indeed, unlike Drabinsky, in this case two serious errors of law were found before this court applied the curative proviso. By definition the application of the curative proviso, the focus of the applicant\u2019s leave application, has not been the subject of appellate review. [27] I consider that the reviewability interest here has more force in the circumstances of this application than was the case in Drabinsky as this case is more akin to the situation of an appellant advancing his first appeal. As to the merits of the application for leave to appeal, there is difficulty inherent for a justice of this court determining the degree of likelihood that leave to appeal will be granted from a judgment of this court. What I can say is that the grounds of appeal appear to have some substance beyond the non-frivolous standard, and engage issues that the Supreme Court of Canada could consider are of national importance. While I would not dip my toe into predicting the outcome of the application for leave, what I know of the application for leave to appeal suggests it is a real step beyond one \u201cdoomed to fail\u201d. [28] I recognize that the offences of which the applicant has been convicted are ones of serious interference with a person. Yet the seriousness of an offence does not preclude bail. Indeed Mapara is a case in which the applicant obtained bail although he had been convicted of first degree murder. [29] On balance, considering the nature of the challenge to this court\u2019s order, I conclude that the reviewability interest marginally outweighs the enforceability interest, and that in the circumstances presented, the applicant has met the requirement of demonstrating that his detention pending determination of his application to the Supreme Court of Canada is not necessary in the public interest, provided that the public safety concerns may be addressed through restrictive terms similar to those imposed by Justice Butler. [30] I would allow the application on terms. [Discussion establishing terms (a) through (r).] \u201cThe Honourable Madam Justice Saunders\u201d",

Chappell, 2020 BCCA 38 Date: 20200124 Docket: CA46104 Between: Regina Respondent And David Lee Chappell Appellant Before: The Honourable Madam Justice Saunders The Honourable Mr. Justice Fitch The Honourable Mr. Justice Butler On appeal from: An order of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, dated March 15, 2019 ( R. v. Chappell , 2019 BCSC 644, Kamloops Dockets 104963\u20112; 105153\u20111\u2011T; 105153\u20112\u2011T; 105154\u20111\u2011T; 105154\u20112\u2011T; 105155\u20111\u2011T; and 105155\u20112\u2011T ). Oral Reasons for Judgment Counsel for the Appellant: C.E. Johnson Counsel for the Respondent: M.G. Scott Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British Columbia January 24, 2020 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia January 24, 2020 Summary: Held: Appeal allowed. A restitution order requiring the appellant to pay in excess of $200,000 to redress damage cased to a tractor\u2011trailer and cargo in the course of a drug\u2011fueled crime spree is set aside. The order was made without enquiry into his ability to pay the amount, and appears to be based on the remote possibility of a windfall. R. v. Dunn, 2010 BCCA 22 applied. A restitution order in the amount of $6,500 in favour of the owner of the unit is issued in place of the one set aside. [1] SAUNDERS J.A. : David Lee Chappell seeks leave to appeal sentence and if leave be granted, appeals from a restitution order in the amount of $201,613.37 made on March 15, 2019, as part of the sentence for a number of offences that took place over six months. The spree culminated in an incident on November 6, 2017, when, attempting to evade arrest, he seized a tractor\u2011trailer, kidnapped the driver at the point of an imitation firearm, and when the driver escaped, attempted to drive the vehicle himself, rolling it down an embankment on the side of a highway. Mr. Chappell had been using crystal methamphetamine at the time of this offence and the sentencing judge described all of the offences as \u201cdrug fuelled\u201d. Mr. Chappell pleaded guilty. [2] At the sentencing hearing, some information was provided to the judge as to Mr. Chappell\u2019s past earning history, which was significant, in the oil and gas industry in Alberta. He had left that industry by the time of the offences. Most of the sentencing hearing concerned the length of the custodial sentence that should be imposed. The Crown sought a global sentence of seven years and seven months for all of his offences. Mr. Chappell sought a sentence of two years less a day after taking into account time served. [3] Also at the sentencing hearing, the Crown sought restitution orders in favour of his former intimate partner whose windshield he had broken, and the insurer of the tractor\u2011trailer, in the amounts of $449.01 and $201,613.37 respectively. In asking for them the Crown explained that they would be stand\u2011alone and not form part of the sentences, but \u201cwould be out there in the event that Mr. Chappell ever wins the lottery\u201d. I understand that by saying they would not form part of the sentence Crown counsel was saying in a colloquial way that the restitution orders would not have penal consequences. The restitution orders, of course, are part of the sentence imposed and give rise to a sentence appeal: R. v. Nanos , 2013 BCCA 339. [4] There was some discussion between counsel for Mr. Chappell and the judge concerning the restitution order in relation to the windshield ($449.01) but through some mistake, no discussion at all with counsel about the restitution order in favour of the insurer. Apart from the assumption, implicit in the Crown\u2019s suggestion that the restitution orders were there in the event Mr. Chappell had a windfall so that it was unlikely Mr. Chappell could satisfy the restitution orders, there was no discussion of the ability of Mr. Chappell to satisfy the orders. [5] The judge imposed a global sentence of five years and six months for the offences, reflecting a reduction in consideration of the totality principle. She then made both restitution orders sought by the Crown pursuant to s. 738 of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C\u201146, and did so without referring to Mr. Chappell\u2019s capacity to pay. [6] Mr. Chappell does not contest the order he pay restitution to his former partner in the amount of $449.01. He appeals only the restitution order aimed at the damage he caused to the tractor\u2011trailer, equipment and cargo. He contends that the court erred in failing to consider his ability to pay the restitution order, both present and future, in accordance with the decision in R. v. Yates , 2002 BCCA 583 para. 17. He acknowledges, as he must, that his counsel did not protest the order at the sentencing hearing, but says that the Crown failed to lay the groundwork for the order by establishing in some fashion that payment was more than a pipe\u2011dream. Mr. Chappell refers us to R. v. Heathcliff , 2015 YKCA 15 at paras. 7\u201313, wherein the Yukon Court of Appeal reduced the amount of a restitution order when the sentencing judge ignored the offender\u2019s ability to pay. [7] We can approach the question before us by asking whether the judge made an error in principle, or whether the sentence is demonstrably unfit. I prefer to address the appeal on the latter question, as it is clear to me that the restitution order imposed is excessive in the context of the information before the judge, so as to render it unfit in the circumstances. I conclude that on the record before us, it is most unlikely that Mr. Chappell will be able to make any meaningful dent in the amount owed, [8] In R. v. Dunn , 2010 BCCA 22, the judge had referred to the capacity of the offender to pay the restitution order by saying as to the likelihood of recovering the money: \u201cWell, if he wins the lottery, I guess so.\u201d Mr. Justice Donald observed that there had been no real inquiry into the capacity to pay the order and, in setting it aside, said: [12] I am unable to say that any useful purpose would be served by a restitution order where the likelihood of compliance is as remote as the judge said. The order was an afterthought made without the benefit of full argument and is unlikely to provide any tangible benefit to the victim. [9] There is no evidence, or even information, before us of prejudice from reliance on the restitution order. On the other hand, we do know that by s. 178(1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act , R.S.C. 1983, c. B\u20113, a discharge from bankruptcy would not discharge Mr. Chappell from the restitution order. In other words, this order is likely to burden him indefinitely, and will make more difficult his rehabilitation as a fully participating member of the community, upon release from custody. [10] I consider that the restitution order in its current amount should be set aside. The question then is whether any order directed to the damage he did to the truck and cargo should be substituted. [11] Mr. Chappell proposes as an alternative to the order appealed, an order in the amount of $6,500 in favour of the owner of the vehicle, being the amount it paid as the deductible. That is not an insignificant sum, but is an amount that Mr. Chappell should be able to satisfy within some reasonable time after release from custody, given his employment history in the past. Accordingly, I would grant leave to appeal sentence, allow the appeal, set aside the restitution order in the amount of $201,613.37, and order that Mr. Chappell make restitution to 1434179 Alberta Ltd. of Grande Cache, Alberta in the amount of $6,500. [12] FITCH J.A. : I agree. [13] BUTLER J.A. : I agree. [14] SAUNDERS J.A. : Leave to appeal sentence is granted, the appeal is allowed, the restitution order in the amount of $201,613.37 is set aside, and an is order made that Mr. Chappell make restitution to 1434179 Alberta Ltd. of Grande Cache, Alberta in the amount of $6,500. \u201cThe Honourable Madam Justice Saunders\u201d",

        "text": "COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA Citation: R. v. Burgoyne, 2021 BCCA 51 Date: 20210120 Docket: CA46884 Between: Regina Respondent And Henry Harold Burgoyne Appellant Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice Abrioux The Honourable Mr. Justice Grauer The Honourable Mr. Justice Voith On appeal from: An order of the Provincial Court of British Columbia, dated May 21, 2020 ( R. v. Burgoyne , Cranbrook Dockets 33877\u20111; 34378\u20112\u2011C). Oral Reasons for Judgment Counsel for the Appellant (via videoconference): B. Blakley M.A.S. Blakley Counsel for the Respondent (via videoconference): C. Lusk Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British Columbia January 20, 2021 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia January 20, 2021 Summary: The appellant pleaded guilty to assault and breaking and entering a dwelling house and committing an indictable offence therein. He appeals a \u201cNo Go\u201d condition of his probation order restraining him from being within 100 kilometres of any place one of the victims lives, works, attends school, worships, or happens to be. Held: Leave to appeal granted; appeal allowed in part. The Crown concedes that the condition as worded amounts to a banishment condition and is unreasonable. The circumstances identified by the sentencing judge justify the imposition of a reasonable \u201cNo Go\u201d condition. The condition is varied by replacing the words \u201c100 kilometres\u201d with \u201c100 metres\u201d. [1] VOITH J.A. : The appellant, Mr. Burgoyne, applies for leave to appeal from sentence and, if leave is granted, appeals a condition of the probation order that was imposed when he was sentenced. He entered guilty pleas to breaking and entering a dwelling house in Invermere, British Columbia, and committing assault therein, and to assaulting Ms. Arlene Hunter, the sister of his wife, Ms. Betty Burgoyne. He was sentenced for these two offences to 700 days\u2019 jail and 90 days\u2019 jail, respectively, to be served concurrently, less 315 days\u2019 credit for 210 days actual time served, to be followed by three years\u2019 probation. [2] On this appeal Mr. Burgoyne takes issue with a single term of the probation order. That condition requires Mr. Burgoyne to \u201cnot go to or be within 100 kilometres of any place where Betty Burgoyne lives, works, attends school, worships, or happens to be\u201d and, in the event he sees her, to \u201cleave her presence immediately without any words or gestures.\u201d [3] The Crown concedes that the impugned condition, as worded, is unreasonable given the length and extent of the geographic restriction but submits that this Court ought to vary, rather than remove, the condition \u201cby substituting metres for kilometres.\u201d [4] The circumstances of Mr. Burgoyne\u2019s offences were captured in an Agreed Statement of Facts. On October 24, 2019, Mr. Burgoyne entered the residence of Ms. Hunter (defined as the \u201cResidence\u201d in the Agreed Statement of Facts). The Residence is located in Invermere, British Columbia. [5] Mr. Burgoyne was intoxicated when he entered the Residence. He then assaulted Ms. Hunter in the Residence by kneeing her in the stomach. He wanted his wife, Ms. Burgoyne, to go home with him, but she refused, saying that he was drunk. Mr. Burgoyne was told to leave the Residence, which he did after some delay. Mr. Burgoyne left the Residence driving a green pickup truck. He was prohibited from driving at the time under the Motor Vehicle Act , R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 318. [6] Mr. Burgoyne then returned and entered the Residence just after midnight. He was carrying a loaded .22 calibre rifle with the safety on. In the hallway, Mr. Michel, another person at the Residence, wrestled the rifle away from Mr. Burgoyne and pushed him out the door. [7] Mr. Burgoyne was arrested a short time later, while driving the green pickup truck. He later stated to the police that Mr. Michel should have let him walk past so that he could shoot Ms. Hunter. [8] Before the sentencing judge, the Crown sought a custodial sentence of six years. The defence sought a sentence of time served. The sentencing judge, in unreported reasons dated May 21, 2020, read the Agreed Statement of Facts into the record. He addressed Mr. Burgoyne\u2019s circumstances, noting that he was 54 years old, that he was of Indigenous descent, that aspects of his life had been difficult, and that a \u201cthorough\u201d Gladue report had been prepared for the sentencing. [9] He addressed Mr. Burgoyne\u2019s criminal record, which consisted of seven convictions over 37 years. Four of those convictions related to driving while impaired. He had two prior convictions for assault and one for assault causing bodily harm, though each of these latter convictions was dated. [10] The sentencing judge addressed the three victim impact statements that had been filed and dealt with two of them, from Ms. Hunter and Ms. Burgoyne, at some length. [11] The sentencing judge noted that Mr. Burgoyne recognized that \u201calcohol and anger were factors\u201d in the offences and that he was an alcoholic. The sentencing judge further noted that, unfortunately, Mr. Burgoyne did not see the need to receive any treatment and that he blamed Ms. Hunter for the offences. The sentencing judge then dealt with the mitigating and aggravating circumstances before the court, several of which are relevant to this appeal. [12] The sentencing judge accepted that Mr. Burgoyne \u201cbelieve[d]\u201d that he had made a stupid mistake and that this would not happen again. It seems clear, however, that the sentencing judge was skeptical about this assurance. He again noted that, unfortunately, Mr. Burgoyne saw \u201cno need to address his alcoholism\u201d and that it appeared he had \u201cno empathy for the harm he has caused to Arlene Hunter and the other victims.\u201d He said, \u201cIt is clear Mr. Burgoyne was not traumatized by what happened and that concerns me.\u201d [13] He emphasized that the offences had occurred at a dwelling house, that Mr. Burgoyne knew the house was occupied, and that there had been some violence, which are deemed to be aggravating circumstances under s. 348.1 of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C\u201146. It was also an aggravating factor that there was a firearm involved. He considered that it was a further aggravating factor that the break and enter had occurred twice. He observed that on the first occasion, when he was confronted, Mr. Burgoyne left the Residence. He also said, \u201cSadly or unfortunately this did not cool off his anger, and he in fact upped the ante and he made everything more terrifying for everyone in that residence.\u201d [14] Still further, the sentencing judge noted that the offences were in the nature of a domestic dispute, and he quoted from portions of s. 718.2(a) of the Criminal Code , which provide that the following are deemed to be aggravating circumstances: (ii) evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused the offender\u2019s intimate partner or a member of the victim or the offender\u2019s family \u2026 (iii.1) evidence that the offence had a significant impact on the victim, considering their age and other personal circumstances, including their health and financial situation \u2026 [15] The trial judge also noted relevant mitigating factors, including the fact that Mr. Burgoyne had pleaded guilty, that he had generally been a productive member of society, and that he did not have a general pattern of antisocial behaviour. He recognized that Mr. Burgoyne was of Indigenous descent and the resulting importance of s. 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code . He noted that the Gladue report he had reviewed had been helpful and informative and that \u201cwithout it the sentence would almost certainly have been higher.\u201d [16] Finally, it is relevant that in imposing various conditions of probation, the judge did not impose any rehabilitative conditions. This is notwithstanding the role that alcohol played in these offences and Mr. Burgoyne\u2019s history of difficulty with alcohol. This was, again, on account of the fact that Mr. Burgoyne was not willing to attend counselling, a fact that was confirmed in the Gladue report that was before the court. Instead, various protective conditions were imposed with reference to the conditions as worded and numbered in the General Harmonized 2019 Probation and Peace Bond Picklist (December 16, 2019) (the \u201cPicklist\u201d). [17] Under condition 2002, the judge imposed a \u201cNo Contact\u201d condition, prohibiting Mr. Burgoyne from directly or indirectly contacting or communicating with Ms. Hunter, Ms. Burgoyne, or a Mr. Jesse Paul. [18] The judge did not purport to rely on condition 2302\u20112, the \u201cBanishment\u201d condition. Instead, under condition 2005\u20111, which is described as a \u201cNo Go\u201d condition, he imposed a condition that Mr. Burgoyne not go or be \u201cwithin 100 kilometres of any place where [Ms.] Burgoyne lives, works, attends school, worships, or happens to be.\u201d However, condition 2005\u20111, as it appears on the Picklist, starts with the words \u201cyou must not go to (or be within ____ metres of)\u201d where one or more named individuals \u201clives, works, attends school, worships, or happens to be.\u201d When the sentencing judge pronounced this condition, the defence inquired, and the judge confirmed, that he had intended to impose a 100\u2011kilometre restriction. [19] Sentencing judges have considerable latitude in crafting appropriate conditions of probation: R. v. Shoker , 2006 SCC 44 at para. 14; R. v. Goddard , 2019 BCCA 164 at para. 19. The sentencing judge\u2019s decision about which conditions to include in a probation order involves an exercise of discretion. An appellate court will intervene in that exercise of discretion only if the judge has erred in principle, imposed a condition that is clearly unreasonable, or if the order is manifestly inappropriate or renders the sentence unfit: Goddard at para. 19; R. v. Manca , 2019 BCCA 280 at para. 42. [20] Under the residual clause in s. 732.1(3)(h) of the Criminal Code , a judge has broad authority to impose reasonable conditions that are considered desirable to protect the public and to facilitate an offender\u2019s reintegration into the community: Manca at para. 39. [21] Conditions of probation do not have to be linked to the offence. There must, however, be a nexus between the offender, the protection of the public, and the offender\u2019s reintegration or rehabilitation into the community: R. v. Duguay , 2019 BCCA 53 at para. 65, citing Shoker at para. 13. Furthermore, conditions may serve either one or both of the purposes of protection of the public and rehabilitation: R. v. Timmins , 2006 BCCA 354 at para. 9; Goddard at para. 23; Duguay at para. 63. Finally, conditions must be clear, unambiguous, enforceable, and compliant with federal and provincial laws and the Charter : Goddard at paras. 20\u201323. [22] Mr. Burgoyne reasonably characterizes the condition at issue, which adopts the language of a \u201cNo Go\u201d condition from the Picklist, as amounting to a banishment condition due to its geographic scope. The Crown agrees with this characterization. Banishment conditions are rare: R. v. Forner , 2020 BCCA 103 at para. 53. They are often viewed as \u201cfundamentally wrong\u201d: Forner at para. 53. In R. v. Rowe (2006), 212 C.C.C. (3d) 254 at para. 7, the Ontario Court of Appeal said, \u201cPlainly, the larger the ambit of the banishment, the more difficult the order will be to justify.\u201d [23] Counsel accept that, if the sentencing judge has made an error in principle, this Court can undertake its own analysis to determine a fit sentence or condition of probation: R. v. Friesen , 2020 SCC 9 at para. 27; Manca at paras. 42, 53, 56. [24] Mr. Burgoyne raises various concerns in relation to the condition that the judge imposed. I have said that the Crown agrees that the condition was inappropriate in the circumstances of this case. There is, accordingly, no need to address aspects of the specific concerns that are raised and developed by Mr. Burgoyne. [25] The only question is whether the No Contact condition that was imposed by the sentencing judge is sufficient, without more, in the circumstances of this case. Alternatively, is a new \u201cNo Go\u201d restriction, which limits Mr. Burgoyne\u2019s ability to go within some reasonable physical distance of where Ms. Burgoyne lives, works, attends school, worships, or happens to be, reasonable in the circumstances of this case? [26] Not surprisingly, such determinations are largely case specific. In R. v. Deering , 2019 NLCA 31, the accused appealed a condition of his probation order that barred him from being present on any part of the Burin Peninsula in Newfoundland south of a particular bridge. He had an \u201cunenviable criminal record\u201d of 82 convictions over 17 years. Of those convictions, 36 involved breaches of probation: at para. 6. The court observed that \u201cthe appellant\u2019s criminal history demonstrates an unwillingness or inability to abide by court orders in general and no\u2011contact orders in particular\u201d: at para. 22. The court upheld the challenged condition of probation. [27] In Forner , the appellant appealed both her custodial sentence and a condition in her probation order that prevented her from being within a 50\u2011kilometre radius of Osoyoos, British Columbia, other than with the written permission of her probation officer. The Court noted that at the time of the offence, the appellant had a 16\u2011year history of alcohol abuse. She expressed what was considered to be genuine and significant remorse about the offence but said she had no memory of it: at para. 12. The Court subsequently emphasized the appellant\u2019s genuine remorse, her post\u2011offence rehabilitation efforts, and her lack of any record of violent behaviour: at para. 50. When addressing the banishment condition, the Court noted the condition would force the appellant to live outside of her community of ordinary residence, thereby likely hindering her rehabilitation: at para. 59. There was also no reason to believe that the condition would render society safer or more secure: at para. 60. [28] Notably, in Forner , the Court considered that there were other conditions in place that would protect the victim of the appellant\u2019s attack. This included both a prohibition on the appellant having any direct or indirect contact or communication with the victim or her family and a further prohibition that prevented her from going to any residence, school, or workplace of the victim or members of her immediate family: at para. 60. Accordingly, the Court considered that \u201cthe safety of the victim and her children has been addressed\u201d: at para. 60. [29] In this case, Mr. Burgoyne\u2019s primary submission is that there is no basis for a \u201cNo Go\u201d condition because there is no evidence that he poses a risk or danger to his wife. In aid of this submission his counsel identifies, for example, that it was Ms. Hunter, rather than Ms. Burgoyne, who was assaulted. [30] This mischaracterizes what occurred. Mr. Burgoyne broke into the Residence to get his wife to leave with him, in circumstances where she made clear that she did not wish to do so. Ms. Hunter was assaulted because she appears to have been in the way. He later returned to the Residence with a loaded weapon. Furthermore, the assertion that he did not assault Ms. Burgoyne, or poses no risk to her, ignores the significant distress and ongoing anxiety that he has caused her. She too was a victim of his actions. [31] Mr. Burgoyne also argued, in the alternative, that some of the language of the \u201cNo Go\u201d condition the sentencing judge imposed should be varied to address various potential scenarios and changes of circumstance. Under s. 732.2(3) of the Criminal Code , it is open to Mr. Burgoyne, should there be such a change of circumstance, to return before the sentencing judge and to seek a variation of the conditions of his probation. [32] In the present circumstances, the various conditions of probation that the sentencing judge imposed were protective, rather than rehabilitative, in nature. Mr. Burgoyne showed no remorse for his offences. His offences took place in an occupied dwelling house and were violent in nature. He showed no interest in addressing his difficulties with alcohol, though he recognized that they had likely fueled his behaviour. He also had some history of violence, albeit dated. The victim impact statements the judge referred to established that Mr. Burgoyne\u2019s behaviour had caused Ms. Burgoyne considerable anxiety and concern for her safety. [33] There is a clear nexus between a reasonable \u201cNo Go\u201d condition and Mr. Burgoyne\u2019s offences. Such \u201cNo Go\u201d conditions, though restrictive, are frequently justified in the case of violent and other offences. There is often no good reason for an offender who has committed a violent offence to be within a limited but fixed distance of the victim or the places she frequents. [34] Further, as previously noted, Mr. Burgoyne drove his pickup truck while prohibited from driving under the Motor Vehicle Act . He was sentenced simultaneously on a separate information for a guilty plea to operating a motor vehicle while prohibited. The sentencing judge referred to a statement attributed to Mr. Burgoyne in his Gladue report that he has never had a driver\u2019s licence, and the judge noted that Mr. Burgoyne appeared to have \u201cno intention of complying with the law\u201d. This demonstrates some unwillingness on Mr. Burgoyne\u2019s part to abide by legal prohibitions. [35] Accordingly, I would grant leave to appeal from sentence and allow the appeal to the extent of varying the \u201cNo Go\u201d condition that was imposed by the sentencing judge by replacing the words \u201c100 kilometres\u201d with \u201c100 metres\u201d. [36] ABRIOUX J.A. : I agree. [37] GRAUER J.A. : I agree. [38] ABRIOUX J.A. : Leave to appeal from sentence is granted and the appeal is allowed to the extent of varying the \u201cNo Go\u201d condition that was imposed by the sentencing judge by replacing the words \u201c100 kilometres\u201d with \u201c100 metres\u201d. \u201cThe Honourable Mr. Justice Voith\u201d",

Ellisdon Corporation, 2019 BCCA 20 Date: 20190110 Docket: CA45610 Between: Polygon Metalworks Int\u2019l. Inc. Appellant (Plaintiff) And Ellisdon Corporation Respondent (Defendant) Before: The Honourable Madam Justice Saunders (In Chambers) On appeal from: An order of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, dated August 28, 2018 ( Polygon Metalworks Int\u2019l Inc. v. Ellisdon Corporation , 2018 BCSC 1448, Vancouver Docket S167197). Oral Reasons for Judgment The Appellant, appearing in person: H. Popa Counsel for the Respondent: K. Johanson S. Small, Articled Student Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British Columbia January 10, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia January 10, 2019 Summary: The appellant was one day late in presenting the appeal record for filing. It missed the deadline due to technical problems in producing the binders. Held: the appellant\u2019s application to extend the time for filing (opposed by the respondent), is granted. The respondent applied for an order security for costs of the appeal be posted. Held: application granted. Security set at $7,000. [1] SAUNDERS J.A. : There are two applications before me today, the appellant\u2019s application to extend the time for filing the appeal record and the respondent\u2019s application for an order the appellant post security for costs within 30 days and that the appeal be stayed pending the security being posted. The respondent proposes the amount to be posted as security for costs be $9,215. [2] Logically the application for an extension of time should be decided first because absent the extension the appeal cannot proceed. [3] The appeal is from a judgment in favour of the appellant in the amount of $2,033.55. The litigation arises from a dispute on a construction project in downtown Vancouver wherein the respondent subcontracted with the appellant to provide and install stainless steel for the project. The original letter of intent contemplated that the appellant would commence onsite work in September 2014. The parties further agreed that the appellant\u2019s work would be completed by November 2015. [4] As it turned out, the appellant could not start working on the project until January 2015. It began installing stainless steel on site in or around March 2015. On November 3, 2015, the respondent purported to terminate the subcontract, citing the existence of outstanding work and claiming that the appellant had contravened the agreed-upon schedule. [5] The appellant commenced an action for an amount far in excess of the judgment it obtained. [6] The appellant filed a notice of appeal on September 26, 2018. The time for filing the appeal record and transcripts expired on November 26, 2018. Mr. Popa has appeared today as the principal of Polygon. He deposes he would have filed the appeal record on November 26, but could not because of problems with printing it and he did not have the pages available that day to have it compiled into the bound document in time to file it in the court registry. That all was done by November 27 but, he deposes, when he presented the appeal record to the registry November 27, the registry refused to allow it to be filed on the basis he was out of time. [7] The respondent, Don Ellis, opposes the extension of time saying that it is not evident on the material filed the appellant has continuously intended to appeal and that the appeal lacks merit. The respondent also says it is not in the interests of justice that the appeal continue. [8] The test for an extension of time is well-known and is set out in Davies v. C.I.B.C. (1987), 15 B.C.L.R. (2d) 256 (C.A.): 1. Was there a bona fide intention to appeal? 2. When were the respondents informed of the intention? 3. Would the respondents be unduly prejudiced by an extension of time? 4. Is there merit in the appeal? 5. Is it in the interests of justice that an extension be granted? The overarching consideration is always the fifth point \u2013 is it in the interests of justice that an extension be granted? [9] The respondent\u2019s submission relating to the appellant\u2019s intention to appeal relies upon a lack of evidence that transcripts have been ordered, the fact that the filing of the transcripts is also out of time, and the absence of any reference to this in today\u2019s application \u2013 the transcripts having been required to be filed at the same time as the appeal record. Mr. Popa says that the transcripts have been ordered, but the order for transcripts is not reflected in any affidavit. [10] On balance I am satisfied the appellant has had a bona fide intention to appeal throughout that intention is demonstrated by the filing of the notice of appeal in a timely way and the appellant\u2019s attempt to file the appeal record, albeit a day late, on November 27. [11] The larger consideration is the merits of the case. Because the appeal is at such an early stage, it is difficult to discern the merits of the appeal. I understand that the appellant contends both that findings of fact are contrary to the documentary evidence and that the judge constricted his ability to cross-examine. Doing the best I can and on the basis of what I know, it seems that there is sufficient merit to warrant the extension of time. I will say that as an appeal progresses more may be known that persuades a judge the appeal is doomed to fail, but in this case I cannot say that now. It does seem to me, however, that the appeal is not strong. [12] I consider in the circumstances that an extension of time to file the appeal record is in the interests of justice. I would extend the time for filing the appeal record to today, January 10, 2019. [13] I note that Mr. Popa still has to receive the transcripts of the trial and that he will require an extension of time in order to file them, absent consent. No doubt the evidence of when the transcripts were ordered will be germane to such an application, and that will all be for a later date. [14] I turn to the application for security for costs. The test for security for costs is set out by Mr. Justice Lowry in Creative Salmon Company Ltd. v. Staniford , 2007 BCCA 285 as follows: [9] The jurisdiction to order security for costs of an appeal is found in s. 24 of the Court of Appeal Act , R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 77. The appellant against which such an order is sought bears the onus of showing why security should not be required: Kedia v. Shandro Dixon Edgson , 2007 BCCA 57 at para. 4 (C.A. Chambers), Smith J.A. Generally, the considerations are the appellant's ability to post security and the likelihood of costs awarded being recovered from it, as well as the merits and the timeliness of the application: Southeast Toyota Distributors, Inc. v. Branch (1997), 45 B.C.L.R. (3d) 163 (C.A.); Milina v. Bartsch (1985), 5 C.P.C. (2d) 124 at 125 (B.C.C.A. Chambers), Seaton J.A.; and M.(M.) v. F.(R.) (1997), 43 B.C.L.R. (3d) 98 at 101 (C.A. Chambers), Esson J.A. The overarching concern is whether the order sought is in the interests of justice. [15] Here the respondent has demonstrated it could not locate exigible assets. The merits of the appeal are not strong. Mr. Popa says in an affidavit he has no assets but he does not say that the appellant has no assets; if he did say that, the statement would demonstrate that the costs will not be readily recoverable. Mr. Popa says that the appellant, which has been struck from the company register, is in the process of being reinstated, but there are, we know, judgments already registered against the company. [16] On balance, I consider that an order for security for costs should be made. I would set the amount of security at $7,000 to be posted within 30 days. This order is accompanied by a stay of the appeal until the security for costs is posted, except for the filing of the appeal record that I have allowed and must be completed today. [17] All of this means, Mr. Popa, that to file the transcripts needed to advance this appeal, you first must post the security for costs and you will need an order allowing you to file the transcripts in any event. [18] I have considered the respondent\u2019s further request for leave to apply to augment the amount of the security for costs in the event unexpected applications or other court proceedings are required to push this appeal to conclusion. I have decided not to make such an order. The respondent, in that event, will have to simply rely upon our Rules for relief. \u201cThe Honourable Madam Justice Saunders\u201d",

Danilovic, 2020 BCCA 36 Date: 20200117 Docket: CA45939 Between: Ljuba Pavlovich Respondent (Plaintiff) And Alexander Gordon Danilovic Appellant (Defendant) Before: The Honourable Madam Justice DeWitt\u2011Van Oosten (In Chambers) On appeal from: An order of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, dated February 11, 2019 ( Pavlovich v. Danilovic , 2019 BCSC 153, Vancouver Docket S158302). Oral Reasons for Judgment Counsel for the Appellant: J.M. Richter A.M. James Counsel for the Respondent: R.D. Bellamy Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British Columbia January 17, 2020 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia January 17, 2020 Summary: The appellant applied to file an amended factum and supplementary appeal book, as well as to adjourn the hearing of the appeal. Held: Application allowed. The additional issue raised by the appellant stems from recent developments in the case law, was raised in the court below, and likely can be addressed on the already\u2011established factual record. An adjournment of the appeal carries little prejudice. [1] DEWITT\u2011VAN OOSTEN J.A. : The appellant, Alexander Danilovic, seeks three orders: (1) leave to file an amended factum; (2) leave to file a supplementary appeal book that includes the closing submissions at trial; and (3) an adjournment of the hearing of the appeal (scheduled for January 22, 2020). [2] The appellant has also filed an application to adduce fresh evidence at the appeal; however, that application is not before me. Instead, it will be determined by the division that hears the appeal on its merits. [3] The appeal arises out of a dispute between the parties about their respective entitlement to beneficial interest in two residential properties purchased by the parties\u2019 parents, both of whom are now deceased. [4] After the mother\u2019s death, and at separate times, each of the properties was made the subject of a joint tenancy between the father and the appellant, Mr. Danilovic. I understand that the second of these transfers was executed solely by the appellant, relying on a power of attorney provided to him by his father that allowed the appellant to transfer the father\u2019s assets to himself. The father passed away and died intestate (a will has not been located). If the joint tenancies effected a transfer of the entire legal and beneficial interest in the properties to the appellant, including rights of survivorship, the properties would not form part of the father\u2019s estate for division amongst any deemed beneficiaries. [5] It is Mr. Danilovic\u2019s position that he is entitled to full legal and beneficial ownership of the properties and that his father intended such to be the case at the time the transfers were made. Ljuba Pavlovich, the appellant\u2019s sister and respondent in this matter, contends that the appellant holds the properties in trust and she is entitled to a share of their value equal to that of any other deemed beneficiaries, including (but not limited to) the appellant. [6] The dispute between the siblings went to trial: Pavlovich v. Danilovic, 2019 BCSC 153 [\u201cTrial Reasons\u201d]. The trial judge rejected the respondent\u2019s submission in favour of an express trust. However, she found that the transfers into a joint tenancy with the appellant were \u201cgratuitous\u201d and, as such, subject to a rebuttable presumption of resulting trust. The judge further found that the appellant did not displace that presumption on the evidence. The judge could not determine the father\u2019s intention on a balance of probabilities. Instead, the \u201cevidence [stood] in equipoise\u201d (at para. 55). In light of this conclusion, and by operation of the presumption, the judge declared that the appellant holds both properties on a resulting trust for the father\u2019s estate (at para. 56). [7] The appellant seeks to overturn the judge\u2019s ruling. In his factum, filed May 31, 2019, he raises one ground of appeal, namely, that the judge committed palpable and overriding error in concluding the appellant failed to rebut the presumption of a resulting trust. [8] The ground of appeal has three components. Specifically, the appellant contends that the judge: (1) failed to consider testimony provided by the appellant\u2019s spouse on the father\u2019s intention in transferring the properties; (2) failed to consider documentary evidence consistent with the appellant\u2019s position; and (3) speculated about the transfer of the properties reflecting an intentional financial strategy that was \u201caimed at saving the family money in probate\u201d. [9] The appellant\u2019s notice of motion, brought on December 20, 2019, seeks to file an amended factum that adds an additional argument in support of his appeal. [10] In particular, he asks for leave to advance the proposition that the trial judge erred in law by limiting her analysis on the father\u2019s intention at the time of the impugned transfers to whether the father intended that the appellant receive beneficial ownership of the properties. The appellant says the judge should have also considered, as a separate possibility, that the father intended to transfer an immediate legal interest, retain beneficial ownership during his lifetime, but give the appellant a right of survivorship that would entitle him to full and exclusive beneficial ownership of both properties upon the father\u2019s death. The appellant says the trial judge failed to appreciate that a right of survivorship is a distinct right accompanying a joint tenancy. [11] The additional ground of appeal has been brought forward seven months after the appellant filed his factum. The hearing of the appeal is less than a week away (as noted, it is scheduled for January 22). The appellant appreciates that the request to amend is late in the day; however, he says it is based on two decisions that were released after he filed his factum, one of which is this Court\u2019s decision in Herbach v. Herbach Estate, 2019 BCCA 370 (released October 11, 2019). The appellant says the case clarifies, at para. 24, that a transfer of property into joint tenancy may consist of an immediate grant of a legal interest and a beneficial right of survivorship, even though the transferor retains beneficial ownership of the property during their lifetime. With this kind of an arrangement, full beneficial ownership of the property vests in the joint tenant upon death. [12] The appellant says that Herbach and a decision out of the British Columbia Supreme Court ( Petrick v. Petrick, 2019 BCSC 1319) raise a critical point that should have been considered by the trial judge on the evidentiary foundation before her. She did not do so and the appellant contends that as a result, the judge applied an incomplete legal test in deciding whether the evidence relied upon by the appellant was sufficient to rebut the presumption of a resulting trust. She could have found that the presumption had been rebutted, even though not satisfied of proof of an intention to transfer beneficial ownership of the properties to the appellant at the time the relevant documents were executed. [13] In fact, the appellant intends to argue that this is the only logical conclusion the trial judge could have reached. She accepted that the father \u201corganized his affairs including his property holdings so as to minimize his tax obligations\u201d on death: Trial Reasons at para. 47. She also found that his actions in doing so were informed by an understanding of the legal consequences of a joint tenancy, based on his assumption of full legal and beneficial ownership of the impugned properties when his wife died many years prior (at para. 47). This would have included a right of survivorship. In light of the judge\u2019s findings, the appellant says that her conclusion about the evidence not rebutting a presumption of resulting trust cannot stand. Had she turned her mind to the right of survivorship as a distinct right, capable of transfer at the time the joint tenancy was created, she would have had to have found that the father\u2019s intention must have been to transfer a right of survivorship in both properties to the appellant, consistent with the results of his own joint tenancy with his spouse. He would have understood that that was the route by which to keep the properties out of his estate and free from the related tax implications. [14] The respondent is opposed to the request to file an amended factum. Among other things, she cites MacMillan Bloedel v. Youell (1993) , 23 B.C.A.C. 214, 43 A.C.W.S. (3d) 7 (B.C.C.A.) and Block Bros. Realty Ltd. v. Boese and Gonzo (1988) , 24 B.C.L.R. (2d) 178 (C.A.), which stand for the proposition that a party should not be allowed to amend their factum shortly before the hearing unless it is beyond doubt that all factual issues relevant to the new issue were before the trial court (see para. 12 of MacMillan and para. 3 of Block Bros. ). The respondent argues that in this case, it cannot be said that all factual issues relevant to the proposed amendments were before the court. To the contrary, the respondent says the issue now sought to be raised is closely entwined with the fresh evidence that the appellant seeks to introduce at the hearing of the appeal, making the point that the appellant cannot substantiate the additional alleged error in the absence of a buttressed evidentiary record. [15] After hearing submissions from both sides, and reviewing the application materials, I am satisfied it is in the interests of justice to grant the appellant leave to amend his factum as requested; grant leave to file a supplementary appeal book with the closing submissions from trial; and adjourn the appeal to ensure that the respondent has sufficient opportunity to respond to the amended factum. In light of this ruling, if the respondent considers it necessary to amend her factum to respond to the new ground of appeal, she has leave to do so. [16] In my view, the additional argument likely can be resolved on the factual record established in the court below, although, ultimately, that will be for the division to determine. The issue is not dependent on the admission of the fresh evidence. This is not a situation akin to Shannon v. Gidden, 1999 BCCA 461 (Chambers), for example, in which leave to file an amended factum was denied because an entirely different body of evidence was required to properly assess the newly found challenge to the judge\u2019s ruling (at para. 6). A central issue at trial in this case was the father\u2019s intention at the time of the impugned transfers. Considerable evidence was called on that point, including the history involving the two properties, the father\u2019s involvement with the properties, and the effect of his spouse\u2019s death on his beneficial ownership of those properties. [17] The judge made specific findings in that regard. The additional legal argument in support of overturning the trial judgment can likely be assessed with reference to those findings, within the context of the reasons as a whole. I agree with the appellant that on the face of it, the supplemental issue is more legal in nature than it is factual and, consistent with the approach taken in MacMillan at para. 13, I am reluctant to deny the appellant an opportunity to advance an issue of that nature. In response to his sister\u2019s notice of civil claim, the appellant pleaded that the father intended to \u201cgift an undivided one half interest\u201d in both properties to the appellant. This pleading is broad enough in scope to include the argument now raised by the appellant. I am also satisfied, based on the closing submissions, that the right of survivorship was addressed by both parties before the trial judge. It was a live issue at trial. [18] The orders sought by the appellant are discretionary. The appeal was filed in March 2019, less than a year ago. The January 22 date is the first hearing date for the appeal and I understand that if adjourned, there is time available for hearing in February and March. In fact, I have been advised that the parties have spoken of a new date and counsel agree the appeal could be heard on March 24. As such, an adjournment will not result in considerable delay. The appellant has provided a legitimate reason for the proposed amendments to his factum and request for an adjournment. I accept that clarity on the proper analytical approach for the assessment of a right of survivorship did not present itself to the appellant until October 2019, when Herbach was released. The proposed amendments to the factum have been articulated and the respondent has been aware of them since December. I do not consider the additional issue to be overly complex. In my view, the prejudice brought about by an amendment, the addition of the closing submissions (already known to the respondent), and a relatively brief adjournment of the appeal, is minimal. [19] The appeal is hereby removed from the hearing list for January 22, 2020, and adjourned generally. Counsel are to confirm March 24, 2020, as the new date as expeditiously as possible. [20] Costs on the application will be costs in the appeal. \u201cThe Honourable Madam Justice DeWitt\u2011Van Oosten\u201d",

        "text": "IN THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA Citation: Onstein v. Onstein, 2020 BCSC 2 Date: 20200102 Docket: E6620 Registry: Prince Rupert Between: Fiona Onstein Claimant And Robert Onstein Respondent Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice Funt Reasons for Judgment Counsel for the Claimant: W. MacGregor A. Lax Counsel for the Respondent: T. Summers Place and Dates of Hearing: Terrace, B.C. November 6, 7, and December 12, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: Prince Rupert, B.C. January 2, 2020 [1] On March 12, 2008, the parties entered into a well-crafted separation agreement (the \u201cSA\u201d), which, among other matters, addresses child support. The parties each had counsel. [2] On August 29, 2017, the claimant filed the SA with the Court. The claimant now applies to enforce the SA: Family Law Act , S.B.C. 2011, c. 25 [ FLA ], s. 148(2); Supreme Court Family Rules , B.C. Reg. 169/2009 [ SCFR ], R. 2-1 and R. 10-5(1). [3] On September 21, 2018, the claimant filed an application seeking a retroactive increase in child support from July 2009 to August 2017. As of July 1, 2009, the parties\u2019 three children were 10, 11 and 13 years old. After August 2017, there was either no longer a duty to provide child support or child support was provided to the claimant\u2019s satisfaction. [4] Over the relevant years, the parties lived within a block of each other in single family houses and co-operated in the raising of each of the children. [5] Each of the children is now well-positioned for the future. Each enjoyed an emotionally and financially supportive environment. [6] For the reasons that follow, the claimant\u2019s application is dismissed. [7] Under the SA, the parties were to remain joint guardians, put the best interests of the children before their own interests, exchange information regularly about the children, and consult about important decisions including education and recreational activities: SA, sections 4 and 6. [8] Section 7 of the SA further provides (in part): 7. (1) Rob [the respondent] shall pay to Fiona [the claimant] for the support and maintenance of the Children the sum of $700.00 per month commencing the 1st day of January, 2008 and the 1st day each month thereafter. (2) Rob shall pay the following extraordinary expenses for the Children: (a) the tuition fees tor the Children to attend Veritas School in Terrace, BC; (b) the Children\u2019s current extracurricular activities, being Scouting and dance and such other extracurricular activities as the parties may agree, provided however, that if the cost of such extracurricular activities increases, the parties shall revisit responsibility for payment of the same; (c) for so long as coverage for the Children through his employment, the medical and dental insurance premiums attributable to the Children and any uncovered amount for medical and dental expenses for the Children. \u2026 (5) The parties agree that the quantum of child support payable by Rob takes into account: (i) the amounts set out in the Federal Child Support Guidelines payable by each parent to the other, for the Children; (ii) the increased costs of the shared custody arrangement; and (iii) the condition, means, needs other circumstances of each spouse and of the Children; \u2026 (8) If a Child, after attaining the age of 19 years, continues to be a child of the marriage as a result of pursing full time education, (i) the parties will review and determine child support for that Child, by reference to the Child\u2019s actual and reasonable needs and expenses, less the amount which, the Child can be expected to contribute to the Child \u2019s own support, and scholarships, bursaries or tax credits; (ii) if a Child lives away from home to attend a post-secondary educational institution the parties will review the amount of support payable in order to take into account reduced food, housing and other costs for the Child when he or she is away at university and the cost of tuition and residency. [9] Under section 8 of the SA, child support shall be reviewed annually. Section 8 reads: 8. (1) By July 1 st of each year, commencing in 2009, child support shall be reviewed. In order to accomplish such review, each of the parties shall provide (a) the documents required in section 21(1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines ; (b) current information about the Children\u2019s special or extraordinary expenses; (c) details of Child Tax Benefit or other Child Benefits received in the previous year and anticipated in the coming year. (2) Unless support is adjusted by an amending agreement in writing, or court order, Rob will continue to pay child support in accordance [with] the parties\u2019 most recent written agreement or court order. [10] Under section 31 of the SA, dispute resolution is addressed. Section 31 reads: 31. (1) If a dispute arises concerning parenting of the Children or payment of child support under this Agreement, the parties will try and resolve the dispute through mediation. (2) If Rob or Fiona seeks a change in paragraph 4 with respect to parenting or paragraph 7 with respect to support, he or she will give the other notice in writing: (a) notice of the proposed change; (b) evidence supporting the proposed change; and (c) any requests for information from the other necessary to determine the issue. (3) A request under section (2) will be answered within fourteen (14) days. (4) After exchanging any information required by this agreement, Fiona and Rob will meet personally or through their personal representatives to resolve the issues in dispute. (5) If they come to an agreement, Rob and Fiona will enter into an amending agreement in writing signed before witnesses. (6) If the parties are unable to come to an agreement with respect to a dispute, the parties shall retain the services of a mediator and each party will be responsible for payment of one-half of the mediation costs. (7) If, notwithstanding their best efforts through use of a mediator, the parties are unable to come to an agreement with respect to a dispute either party may apply to a court or competent jurisdiction to resolve the matter. [11] Two further general sections of relevance to the case at bar read: 35. The parties may vary this Agreement only by written agreement executed in the same manner as this Agreement. 36. Rob and Fiona will each do everything reasonably necessary to give full effect to this Agreement. [12] Finally, under section 42 of the SA, the parties acknowledge: (a) each of them relies on this Agreement to be enforced according to its terms; and (b) neither of them would have entered into this Agreement or continued their relationship [on] the basis of it, had it been anticipated that the other would ever apply to vary the Agreement. [13] As noted, section 8 of the SA refers to documents requested under s. 21(1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines , SOR/97-175 [ FCSG ]. Section 21(1) of the FCSG reads: Obligation of applicant 21 (1) A spouse who is applying for a child support order and whose income information is necessary to determine the amount of the order must include the following with the application: (a) a copy of every personal income tax return filed by the spouse for each of the three most recent taxation years; (b) a copy of every notice of assessment and reassessment issued to the spouse for each of the three most recent taxation years; (c) where the spouse is an employee, the most recent statement of earnings indicating the total earnings paid in the year to date, including overtime or, where such a statement is not provided by the employer, a letter from the spouse\u2019s employer setting out that information including the spouse\u2019s rate of annual salary or remuneration; (d) where the spouse is self-employed, for the three most recent taxation years (i) the financial statements of the spouse\u2019s business or professional practice, other than a partnership, and (ii) a statement showing a breakdown of all salaries, wages, management fees or other payments or benefits paid to, or on behalf of, persons or corporations with whom the spouse does not deal at arm\u2019s length; (e) where the spouse is a partner in a partnership, confirmation of the spouse\u2019s income and draw from, and capital in, the partnership for its three most recent taxation years; (f) where the spouse controls a corporation, for its three most recent taxation years (i) the financial statements of the corporation and its subsidiaries, and (ii) a statement showing a breakdown of all salaries, wages, management fees or other payments or benefits paid to, or on behalf of, persons or corporations with whom the corporation, and every related corporation, does not deal at arm\u2019s length; (g) where the spouse is a beneficiary under a trust, a copy of the trust settlement agreement and copies of the trust\u2019s three most recent financial statements; and (h) in addition to any income information that must be included under paragraphs (c) to (g), where the spouse receives income from employment insurance, social assistance, a pension, workers compensation, disability payments or any other source, the most recent statement of income indicating the total amount of income from the applicable source during the current year, or if such a statement is not provided, a letter from the appropriate authority stating the required information. [14] The respondent paid all expenses under s. 7 of the FCSG , including many of the children\u2019s post-secondary expenses (tuition, books, flights, and set-up costs). [15] The respondent has also paid for other expenses for the children beyond s. 7 expenses. [16] Each child enjoyed living in a single family house and was able to engage in activities consistent with the best interests of the child. As noted, the parties lived close by in a single family home neighbourhood. Until May 2017, the parties enjoyed a co-operative parenting relationship, including adjusting child support as a child switched residences. [17] Between 2009 and 2016, several changes were made to the monthly child support the respondent paid as a result of the changing living arrangements of one or more of the children. The changes were by agreement following conversations between the parties. A formal review under section 31 of the SA was not engaged. The changes were not documented by the parties. [18] Neither party produced annually the documents required under section 8(1) of the SA, including \u201cthe documents required under s. 21(1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines \u201d. [19] On August 29, 2017, the claimant filed an application for an order that the respondent provide his financial information from 2009 onwards in accordance with section 8 of the SA. [20] By August 31, 2017, the respondent had provided many of the documents he was required to provide under section 8(1)(a) of the SA. The claimant\u2019s initial request made on or about June 22, 2017 was for \u201cthe last two years\u201d. [21] On September 21, 2018, the claimant filed the current application seeking retroactive child support. On November 14, 2018, the respondent provided additional documents. The claimant is not seeking further financial documents from the respondent in relation to section 8(1)(a) of the SA. [22] For the scheduled November 2019 assize hearing, the claimant did not provide all of the documents she was required to produce under section 8(1)(a) of the SA (with reference to s. 21(1) of the FCSG ). [23] On December 5, 2019, the claimant applied to have the two-day assize hearing, which concluded November 7, 2019, re-opened in order to enter into evidence her 2009, 2014, 2015, and 2016 income tax returns. A 9 a.m. 55-minute hearing was held December 12, 2019. At this hearing, claimant\u2019s counsel stated that the tax returns for the other relevant years would also be provided. In the claimant\u2019s application to re-open, the claimant states that \u201cdue to error or oversight\u201d of her counsel (Mr. MacGregor, for the November 6 and 7, 2019 hearing), the income tax returns were not provided to respondent\u2019s counsel or entered into evidence. For the November 6 and 7, 2019 hearing, income tax summaries (not the complete returns) were provided. [24] Under the SA, the income tax returns were required to have been produced. [25] At the November 6 and 7, 2019 hearing, respondent\u2019s counsel had sought greater detail. The income tax returns provide some of this detail but not necessarily all of the sought detail. The respondent\u2019s counsel wishes to cross-examine the claimant on her income tax returns if \u201canything turns on it\u201d. In light of my overall conclusion, the claimant\u2019s income tax returns are not determinative of the matter at bar. [26] I will allow the claimant\u2019s relevant income tax returns to be included in the evidence at this time. The income tax returns are source documents for the income tax summaries. [27] The claimant acknowledges that after August 2017, no child support is owing. Either a child was not a child of the marriage or the respondent paid support under section 7(8) of the SA. [28] In bringing her application, the claimant has not followed the dispute resolution procedure in section 31 of the SA with respect to her claim for child support. [29] The claimant says that the respondent\u2019s failure to provide annually the requisite documents under section 8(1) of the SA is blameworthy conduct by him. It lies ill in the mouth for the claimant to make this argument where she did not provide the documents required of her under section 8(1) of the SA. [30] If the claimant had wished to seek an adjustment in child support, section 31 of the SA provided a practical way to do so without incurring from the outset litigation costs for both parties. [31] Under section 31 of the SA, the claimant was required to provide written notice. The written notice needed to state, for example, that she wished to increase child support based on the FCSG income of each party. As evidence supporting the proposed change, the claimant could have provided her relevant income tax returns (and other information under section 8 of the SA) and to the extent the respondent had not provided requisite information (such as his tax returns) to request such. The matter would then be resolved by the parties, or failing agreement, through mediation, and if mediation failed, by recourse to the Court. [32] The claimant is now seeking to enforce the SA despite not having complied with the dispute resolution process set forth in the SA. [33] The claimant does not provide a reasonable explanation for not providing her financial information or seeking the respondent\u2019s financial information before 2017. [34] In her second affidavit, filed July 18, 2018, the claimant says: Because Rob has never provided me with financial information, and because he has never requested financial information from me except in response to my requests for such information, I have not provided him with financial information. [35] The claimant does not explain the reason she did not follow the procedure the parties agreed to under the SA for dispute resolution. [36] I will dismiss the claimant\u2019s application on the basis that she has not followed the SA\u2019s dispute resolution procedures. These procedures were designed to facilitate the timely and conciliatory resolution of any proposed change in child support with recourse to the Court as the last resort. The claimant is asking the Court to enforce the SA she filed with the Court, despite not following its dispute resolution procedure. [37] Absent a good reason, courts recognize separation agreements, because, among other matters, they provide certainty, reduce costs, and serve to avoid litigation. [38] In the case at bar, the law of contract applies. Recourse to the principles of estoppel is not necessary: B. MacDougall, Estoppel (2nd ed) LexisNexis Canada Inc., 2019, at para. 2:23. [39] In dismissing the claimant\u2019s application, I am mindful that child support is the right of the child. [40] If the claimant had in any particular year thought the children\u2019s needs were not sufficiently funded, she could have given notice under section 31(2) of the SA. As noted, the claimant and the respondent were living in separate nearby houses with a co-operative parenting relationship, including adjusting child support as a child switched residences. Each child was raised in a supportive environment. [41] With respect to a supportive environment, I note that when one of the children was 16 years of age and had a particularly serious problem that caused the claimant to be justifiably upset with the child, the respondent helped by having the child live with him. Similarly, when one of the other children wished to live with the claimant full-time as a result of a curfew dispute with the respondent, the child lived with the claimant. [42] In M.A.M. v. D.L.L. , 2018 BCSC 2114, Justice Ker summarized the court\u2019s discretion to make a retroactive child support order. Justice Ker stated: [90] The discretion to make an order of retroactive child support is found in ss. 15.1 and 17 of the Divorce Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. 3 (2nd Supp.) and ss. 152 or 170(b) of the FLA (depending on whether it is a variation order or not). The circumstances in which retroactive child support may be awarded were addressed in [ D.B.S. v. S.R.G ., 2006 SCC 7]. The Supreme Court of Canada directed trial judges to adopt a broad and holistic approach in the application of four factors, summarized at para. 133, none of which is determinative on its own: \u00b7 Is there a reasonable excuse for why support was not sought earlier? \u00b7 Was there any blameworthy conduct on the part of the payor parent? \u00b7 Is a retroactive award appropriate in light of the child\u2019s past and present circumstances? \u00b7 Will a retroactive award cause hardship to the payor parent or to his or her other children? [43] The claimant does not have a reasonable excuse for not seeking increased child support sooner. She had before her the SA which provided a cost-conscious dispute resolution procedure. [44] With the SA dispute resolution procedure available to the claimant and with the needs of each of the parties\u2019 children apparently addressed as the years passed, I do not find the respondent to be blameworthy. [45] With respect to the past and present circumstances of each child, I do not see a particular reason for retroactive child support. Each child was raised in an emotionally and financially supportive environment and each is currently well-positioned for the future. [46] Finally, although a retroactive award would not necessarily cause hardship to the respondent, I am satisfied there is prejudice. Individuals need certainty in planning their financial affairs. A retroactive award undermines that certainty. Further, in the case at bar, the respondent paid all of the children\u2019s s. 7 expenses. It would be difficult for him to now show all of the past s. 7 expenditures he has made since July 2009. Accordingly, the respondent is not readily in a position to prove all of the s. 7 expenditures he has made in order to be in a position to defend against an award of child support for past years. [47] The claimant\u2019s application is dismissed. [48] The respondent is the successful party on the application. He is awarded his reasonable costs and disbursements for a matter of ordinary difficulty. \u201cFunt J.\u201d",

Respondents (Plaintiffs) And Remon Hanna Appellant (Defendant) Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice Frankel The Honourable Mr. Justice Goepel The Honourable Madam Justice Griffin Supplementary Reasons to Malak v. Hanna , 2019 BCCA 106. Counsel for the Appellants, P.K. Jackman, Valley Traffic Systems Inc., and T. Paine T.J. Delaney Counsel for the Appellant, R. Hanna: D.W. Burnett, Q.C. Counsel for the Respondents: R.A. McConchie Written Submissions Received: November 6, 20, 26, and 29, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia January 7, 2020 Supplementary Reasons of the Court Summary: Application with respect to costs. Four appellants were found jointly and severally liable for defamation. Three of them appealed together and the fourth appealed separately. The appeals, which raised different issues, were heard together and allowed in part. The three appellants succeeded on most of their issues while the remaining appellant had very limited success. A new trial was ordered on limited issues. Held: As the three appellants were substantially successful they were entitled to costs on their appeal. It was not appropriate to make the fourth appellant responsible for those costs by means of a Sanderson order or a Bullock order. Supplementary Reasons for Judgment of the Court: [1] In reasons for judgment indexed as Malak v. Hanna , 2019 BCCA 106, we dealt with two appeals brought by four appellants from a trial in which they were found jointly and severally liable with respect to numerous publications of defamatory statements. The trial judge found those appellants had engaged in a campaign of vilification against the respondents, Raoul Malak and his companies. The first appeal was brought by Philip Keith Jackman, Trevor Paine, and Valley Traffic Systems Inc. (\u201cVTS\u201d) (CA44856). Mr. Jackman owns VTS and Mr. Paine is its vice-president. The second appeal was brought by Remon Hanna (CA44858). The appeals were heard together. Both were allowed in part. [2] These reasons concern the issue of costs in CA44856. For convenience we will refer to the respondents in that appeal collectively as \u201cMr. Malak\u201d. [3] Messrs. Jackman and Paine and VTS take the position they are entitled to costs on their appeal. Mr. Malak takes the following alternative positions: (a) as success was divided, the parties should bear their own costs; (b) as a new trial was ordered on the basis of the adequacy of the trial judge\u2019s reasons, the parties should bear their own costs; (c) if Messrs. Jackman and Paine and VTS are entitled to costs, then costs should be apportioned on a percentage-of-success basis and set off; (d) if Messrs. Jackman and Paine and VTS are entitled to costs, then a Sanderson order should be made against Mr. Hanna requiring him to pay those costs (see Sanderson v. Blyth Theatre Co. , [1903] 2 K.B. 533 (C.A.)); and (e) if Messrs. Jackman and Paine and VTS are entitled to costs from Mr. Malak, then a Bullock order should be made against Mr. Hanna allowing Mr. Malak to recover those costs as a disbursement in CA44858 (see Bullock v. London General Omnibus Co. , [1907] 1 K.B. 264 (C.A.)). [4] In our reasons allowing the appeals in part, we: (a) set aside all the liability findings against Mr. Paine and VTS, and all but one of the liability findings against Mr. Jackman; and (b) ordered a new trial limited to whether VTS is vicariously liable for Mr. Hanna\u2019s actions and whether Mr. Jackman and Mr. Paine are liable for those actions on the basis they participated with Mr. Hanna in a common design. [5] We consider this outcome to constitute substantial success by Mr. Jackman, Mr. Paine, and VTS. It is well-established that a party that achieves substantial success on appeal is entitled to costs and that substantial success does not require success of all issues: Doucette v. McInnes , 2012 BCCA 235 at para. 19, 322 B.C.A.C. 170; Stein v. Stein , 2007 BCCA 187 at para. 8, 68 B.C.L.R. (4th) 104; Canadian Centre for Bio-Ethical Reform v. South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority , 2018 BCCA 440 at paras. 4\u20136, 18 B.C.L.R. (6th) 375. [6] In support of his submission that the parties should bear their own costs, Mr. Malak cites Ciolli v. Galley , 2011 BCCA 106 at para. 34, 302 B.C.A.C. 15. Ms. Ciolli was injured in several motor vehicle accidents and the damages actions she commenced were tried together. This Court allowed the defendants\u2019 appeals and ordered a new trial on the ground that the trial judge erred in not giving the jury an even-handed summary of the evidence or adequate instructions. The Court further held that the \u201cfairest course\u201d was to order the parties to bear their own costs of the appeal. However, as pointed out in Harder v. Poettcker , 2017 BCCA 107 at para. 8, 96 B.C.L.R. (5th) 242, the result in Ciolli was that the parties were returned to \u201csquare one\u201d. That is not the result of the appeal in the present matter. [7] As to a Sanderson or Bullock order, we would not exercise our discretion to make Mr. Hanna responsible for the costs awarded against Mr. Malak in CA44856. This is because Mr. Hanna did nothing to warrant his having to pay those costs: see Grassi v. WIC Radio Ltd. , 2001 BCCA 376 at paras. 33, 89 B.C.L.R. (3d) 198; Moore v. Wienecke , 2008 BCCA 162 at paras. 44\u201350, (2008), 290 D.L.R. (4th) 509. Of note is that the two appeals raised different issues. The only common issues were the challenges to the findings of common design and vicarious liability. However, in that regard, Mr. Hanna did no more than adopt the arguments advanced by Messrs. Jackman and Paine and VTS. [8] In the result, we order costs in favour of Messrs. Jackman and Paine and VTS in CA44856. In addition, we order that Mr. Hanna is entitled to set off his costs relating to this application against the costs ordered against him in CA44858. \u201cThe Honourable Mr. Justice Frankel\u201d \u201cThe Honourable Mr. Justice Goepel\u201d \u201cThe Honourable Madam Justice Griffin\u201d",

        "text": "COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA Citation: Li v. Rao, 2019 BCCA 56 Date: 20190130 Dockets: CA45061; CA45103 Docket: CA45061 Between: Peipei Li Respondent (Claimant) And Luhua Rao Appellant (Respondent) - and - Docket: CA45103 Between: Peipei Li Respondent (Claimant) And Lu Hua Rao Appellant (Respondent) Before: The Honourable Madam Justice Fenlon (In Chambers) On appeal from: An order of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, dated January 30, 2018 ( Li v. Rao , 2018 BCSC 142, Vancouver Docket E170206). Oral Reasons for Judgment Counsel for the Appellant: P.R. Albi, Q.C. M.A. Clemens, Q.C J. Parker Counsel for the Respondent: B.B. Olthuis A.C. Bjornson Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British Columbia January 23, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia January 30, 2019 Summary: Application to stay two appeals pending the resolution of a related action in the court (\u201cSettlement Action\u201d). Held: application dismissed. The parties have brought a multiplicity of proceedings in multiple jurisdictions, and it is not clear that resolution of the Settlement Action would end the litigation. Since the appeals are not brought from orders in the Settlement Action, the concern of avoiding litigating in slices does not weigh as heavily in favour of staying the appeals pending its resolution. Further, the respondent\u2019s appeals can be heard expeditiously. As a result, the prejudice to the respondent from the delay in hearing the appeals if the stay is granted outweighs the prejudice to the applicant from having to respond to the appeals while the Settlement Action continues. [1] FENLON J.A. : The respondent Peipei Li applies to have two appeals stayed pending resolution of an action in the Supreme Court to enforce a settlement. Ms. Li asserts that the parties entered into a comprehensive settlement in March 2018 resolving all matters between them. [2] The appellant Lu Hua Rao is a businessman residing in China, and Ms. Li is a businesswoman residing in Vancouver. The two are currently parties to at least six different legal proceedings, all arising out of essentially the same factual background and seeking overlapping relief. [3] In or about August 2015 the parties commenced a romantic relationship and eventually underwent a marriage ceremony in Las Vegas, even though Mr. Rao was already married. He says he told Ms. Li he was married and would not leave his wife and two sons, but went through with the marriage ceremony because Ms. Li told him a Las Vegas marriage hardly had any effect and would help them to get mortgage financing for their real estate venture and assist with immigration. For her part, Ms. Li says it was a bona fide marriage and she was later shocked and distressed to discover Mr. Rao was already married in China. [4] On the business side of their relationship, the parties incorporated LPP Properties Inc. (\u201cLPP\u201d), and each received 50% of the shares. They agreed that Mr. Rao would contribute $20 million to the company for his shares and Ms. Li would contribute $1,000. Mr. Rao actually invested $17.65 million. Those funds were distributed to an account controlled jointly by the parties and to an account held by Ms. Li personally. The transfers occurred by way of promissory notes and directions to pay executed by Mr. Rao. [5] The parties\u2019 relationship collapsed in acrimony in late 2016. They immediately became embroiled in a series of proceedings all of which arose out of their relationship and business dealings. Central to their disputes is whether Ms. Li used the $17.65 million invested by Mr. Rao in accordance with the parties\u2019 agreement. [6] The proceedings are as follows: \u00b7 In December 2016 Mr. Rao commenced a civil proceeding (the Civil Claim) in Supreme Court claiming that Ms. Li had transferred and used LPP funds without his knowledge and contrary to their agreement. \u00b7 In January 2017 Ms. Li commenced a family proceeding in Supreme Court seeking a divorce, support and division of family property (the Family Claim). Mr. Rao filed a counterclaim in that proceeding. \u00b7 Early in 2017 Ms. Li also commenced proceedings in China alleging Mr. Rao had committed bigamy. That led to criminal proceedings against Mr. Rao by the Chinese government. \u00b7 In March 2017 Mr. Rao started a family action in China seeking a declaration that the Las Vegas marriage was a nullity. \u00b7 In June 2017 Mr. Rao commenced an arbitration in China under the terms of the parties\u2019 agreement which provided for resolution of disputes in that forum (the CIETAC arbitration). In that proceeding he seeks return of the funds advanced to the company and does not mention the romantic component of his relationship with Ms. Li. \u00b7 Finally, Mr. Rao commenced an action in the Supreme Court advancing the same civil claim and seeking the same relief as the CIETAC arbitration, under s. 9 of the International Commercial Arbitration Act , R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 233 as an interim measure of protection to toll the limitation period given Ms. Li\u2019s jurisdictional challenge to the CIETAC arbitration. [7] In March 2018 the parties met in person in Hong Kong. Ms. Li asserts they came to a settlement, but Mr. Rao backed out of that agreement in late April 2018 when he realized the significant tax consequences flowing from the terms agreed to. [8] In August 2018 Ms. Li commenced civil proceedings in the Supreme Court to enforce the settlement (the Settlement Claim). The terms of the settlement asserted by Ms. Li are as follows: (1) Mr. Rao would receive the balance of the company funds remaining, amounting to approximately $8 million; (2) Ms. Li would receive the Vancouver residential property that was purchased with some of the funds, free and clear of any claim by Mr. Rao; (3) Mr. Rao would remove any liens or other encumbrances he had caused to be placed on the Vancouver residential property; (4) Ms. Li would receive Mr. Rao\u2019s shares in the company and all of the company\u2019s remaining assets; and (5) The parties would withdraw any and all claims made against the other including the Family Claim, the Civil Claim, and the CIETAC arbitration. [9] I turn now to the two appeals Ms. Li seeks to stay. The first, Appeal CA45103, is from an order of Madam Justice Forth made in the Family Claim on January 30, 2018. Justice Forth declared the marriage to be void ab initio , but dismissed Mr. Rao\u2019s November 2017 application to strike Ms. Li\u2019s claim for division of family property and spousal support. [10] The second, Appeal CA45061, is from the order of Mr. Justice Funt, also in the Family Claim, made January 12, 2018 enjoining Mr. Rao from taking any further steps in the CIETAC arbitration and enjoining him from requiring Ms. Li to take any steps in that proceeding without leave of the Supreme Court. This order effectively prevented Mr. Rao from withdrawing the Civil Claim and proceeding only with the arbitration. [11] As I have noted, Ms. Li applies for stay of the appeals pending determination of the Settlement Action which she says would resolve all proceedings between the parties, including the Family Claim underlying the orders under appeal, thereby rendering the appeals moot. [12] A single justice may grant a stay of an appeal proceeding pending the occurrence of a certain event, such as the decision of another body, pursuant to subparagraphs 10(2)(a) and (b) of the Court of Appeal Act , R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 77 : Hollander v. Nelson , 2013 BCCA 83 at paras. 14, 21 (D. Smith J.A. in Chambers), citing Taga Ku Development Corp. v. Yukon Territory (1995), 55 B.C.A.C. 266 (Legg J.A. in Chambers). [13] There are two principles animating a decision whether to stay an appeal pending a decision from another body, such as a trial court: Habitat for Humanity Canada v. Hearts and Hands for Homes Society , 2015 BCCA 443 at para. 24. The first concerns the public interest in the efficient use of judicial resources and avoiding \u201clitigating in slices\u201d: Habitat for Humanity at para. 24; Hollander at paras. 25\u201327. The second is balancing the prejudice between the parties. The Court must ask whether the prejudice from a delay in completing the proceedings in the court below to the party applying for the stay outweighs the prejudice to the other party of a delay in hearing the appeal: Habitat for Humanity at para. 25; Taga Ku at para. 14. [14] This test may respond more flexibly to the considerations relevant to deciding whether to stay an appeal itself as opposed to an order appealed from than the traditional three-part inquiry from RJR-MacDonald Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General) , [1994] 1 S.C.R. 311: Korea Data Systems (USA), Inc. v. Aamazing Technologies Inc. , 2012 ONCA 756 at para. 19. [15] Ms. Li submits that, by any measure, six proceedings dealing with the same set of circumstances and seeking overlapping relief does not amount to an efficient use of judicial resources. She argues that, irrespective of the outcome, the two appeals will not serve to conclude the dispute between the parties \u2014 one, if successful, will lead to the CIETAC arbitration intensifying, and the other, while striking the property and spousal support claims from the Family Claim, would leave to be resolved the constructive trust claims advanced both by Ms. Li and by Mr. Rao\u2019s counterclaim in that action. [16] Ms. Li asserts that if the Settlement Action is permitted to proceed while everything else is held in abeyance, it could resolve all of the disputes in the proceedings between the parties. In relation to balancing prejudice, she submits that if the Settlement Action is unsuccessful, Mr. Rao can simply resume his appeals, whereas if she is required to go through the appeals, the cases will continue and she will be left to battle through various proceedings as well as the Settlement Action, incurring significant costs. Given the history of the litigation between the parties, she stresses that further appeals may follow. [17] The application for stays of appeal in this case differs from the stays sought in Habitat , Hollander , and Taga Ku , all of which involved the staying of an appeal until matters in the single underlying cause of action could be completed. The arguments in those cases therefore focused on the disadvantage of litigating in slices, described by Southin J.A. in Digital.Doc Services (Canada) Inc. v. Future Chop Ltd. (1998), 49 B.C.L.R. (3d) 78 (C.A.): [5] It is obvious to us that what is happening here is what I have called before \u201clitigating in slices\u201d and that form of litigating may result in several matters coming before this Court at different times relating to this obviously highly contested litigation. It is not in the public interest that several panels of this Court should have to deal with several little bits of a lawsuit now and then and here and about. Therefore, we are going to stay of the proceedings now pending in this Court. When Madam Justice Baker has handed down her judgment, the parties will have to consider how to put all of these matters together in an appropriate way so that the time of this Court which belongs to the public and not to us, will not be wasted this way. [Emphasis added.] [18] In contrast, the parties before me are engaged in multiple proceedings in various forums and countries. They appear to have adopted a strategy of litigation warfare on both sides and on all fronts. In this context, a ceasefire to enable the Settlement Action to run its course and potentially end the war by resolving all of the extant proceedings is attractive. The saving in court time and costs to the parties tends to staying the appeals to permit the Settlement Action to be determined. However, there are a number of other considerations that tend to the contrary view. [19] First, I begin by noting that it is not plain on the record before me that Ms. Li is likely to succeed in proving the settlement she asserts. Her own lawyer, in forwarding a draft form of agreement to Mr. Rao\u2019s lawyer, referred to the parties having agreed to a framework for settlement. Although it is possible that Ms. Li will be successful, again, I restrict my remarks to the record I have before me \u2014 that of course cannot be assumed, and even if successful at trial, an appeal could well follow. If Ms. Li is not successful, Mr. Rao will have been delayed considerably in his pursuit of the $17.5 million he invested in LPP. [20] Second, and more significantly, the Settlement Action is only at the pleadings stage. Ms. Li has filed a notice of civil claim and Mr. Rao is in the process of preparing his response. Although Ms. Li submits the entire case could be dealt with within a year, that seems improbable. As I see it, there is no prospect of the Settlement Action being resolved expeditiously given the inherent complexity in such an action \u2013 many documents will have to be translated from Mandarin, Mr. Rao lives in China and can only proceed through an interpreter, and there is a prospect of a third party proceeding. In addition, there is little reason to anticipate the parties will depart from their aggressive approach to litigation. [21] In contrast, the appeal in the Family Claim from Justice Forth\u2019s order is ready to proceed. All factums and books have been filed and it could be heard within a few months. If that appeal succeeds, it will dispose of a significant portion of the Family Claim and remove a layer of complexity raised by the romantic component of the parties\u2019 relationship. [22] I also take into account the timing of Ms. Li\u2019s application for a stay of Mr. Rao\u2019s two appeals. As I have noted, the appeal in the Family Claim is ready to be heard. The appeal from the order of Justice Funt freezing the CIETAC proceedings is at an early stage but leave was applied for in January 2018 and obtained in May 2018 without Ms. Li raising the settlement she now asserts occurred in April. Mr. Rao incurred the expense of that leave to appeal application and filed his appeal record on July 23, 2018, all before Ms. Li commenced the Settlement Action in August 2018 and applied for a stay. [23] Mr. Rao intends to apply to have the two appeals heard at the same time and based on much of the same record. If Mr. Rao succeeds on appeal, he will be able to continue with the CIETAC arbitration. If the arbitrator assumes jurisdiction of the contractual disputes, many of the issues between the parties will be resolved outside of this jurisdiction. [24] Taking all of these factors into account, and in particular: \u00b7 the length of time the appeals will have to be stayed until the Settlement Action can be concluded; \u00b7 Ms. Li\u2019s failure to proceed expeditiously to seek a stay of the appeals after Mr. Rao denied a settlement had occurred; and \u00b7 the steps taken by Mr. Rao in the appeals which are close to ready to proceed; I am of the view that the prejudice to Mr. Rao in delaying the completion of the appeals in this Court outweighs the prejudice to Ms. Li of requiring her to respond to them. I therefore dismiss the applications to stay both appeals. \u201cThe Honourable Madam Justice Fenlon\u201d",

        "text": "IN THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA Citation: Herrera v. Miller, 2020 BCSC 62 Date: 20200108 Docket: M1811642 Registry: Vancouver Between: Willard Herrera Plaintiff And Marilyn Louise Miller and John Torrance Miller Defendants Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice Giaschi Oral Reasons for Judgment In Chambers Counsel for the Plaintiff: V. Sewell Counsel for the Defendants: C. Carey Place and Dates of Hearing: Vancouver, B.C. January 7 and 8, 2020 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, B.C. January 8, 2020 [1] THE COURT: I will deliver my reasons now. I reserve the right to amend these reasons for grammar and clarity, and to include full citations and quotations. The result will not change as a consequence of any such amendments. [2] The plaintiff was involved in a motor vehicle accident on November 2, 2017, in which he alleges that he suffered injuries, including to the back, shoulder and neck and that he suffers from chronic pain, headaches, sleeplessness and anxiety. The defendants now apply to have this matter transferred to the Provincial Small Claims Court. The effect of the transfer, if ordered, will be to limit the plaintiff\u2019s claim in damages to $35,000. [3] The governing statutory provision is s. 15 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 443: 15 A judge or master may transfer proceedings to the Provincial Court of British Columbia if (a) the proceedings are within the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court under the Small Claims Act, (b) a party to the proceedings applies to the judge or master, or all parties to the proceedings agree to the transfer, and (c) the judge or master considers it appropriate to do so. [4] Also relevant is Rule 14\u20111 (10) of the Supreme Court Civil Rules , B.C. Reg 168/2009, which provides that if a plaintiff recovers an amount in the Supreme Court that is within the monetary jurisdiction of the Provincial Court, the plaintiff is not entitled to costs except disbursements, unless the court finds that there was sufficient reason for bringing the matter in the Supreme Court: Costs in cases within small claims jurisdiction (10) A plaintiff who recovers a sum within the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court under the Small Claims Act is not entitled to costs, other than disbursements, unless the court finds that there was sufficient reason for bringing the proceeding in the Supreme Court and so orders. [5] The appropriate test under s. 15 is two-fold: first, is the proceeding sought to be transferred within the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court?; and second, is transfer appropriate in the circumstances?: Cort v. Insurance Corporation of British Columbia , 2011 BCSC 586. [6] With respect to the first step in the test, the defendants submit that this matter is within the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court as the damages cannot be more than $35,000. They submit that the motor vehicle accident was relatively minor, that the plaintiff suffered insignificant injuries for which he received very little treatment, and that the injuries did not seriously affect the plaintiff\u2019s enjoyment of recreational and sporting activities, or his employment. The defendants rely heavily upon the evidence of the plaintiff given at his examination for discovery. [7] With respect to the second part of the test, there are a number of factors that can be considered, including delay, the need for Supreme Court pre-trial procedures, the availability of jury trials, and the complexity of the case. [8] The plaintiff submits that the pain suffered as a consequence of his injuries is now chronic, that he attends massage therapy to manage his pain and plans to have chiropractic treatments to further address his symptoms. [9] Both parties have referred me to case law relating to the assessment of damages. [10] The defendant refers me to Sidor v. Coulter , 2013 BCPC 0011, and the cases cited therein in support of their submission that the plaintiff\u2019s damages in this matter will not exceed $35,000. [11] In contrast, the plaintiff refers me to several cases: Harry v. Powar , 2018 BCSC 845, Poulin v. Armstrong , 2019 BCSC 926 and Carson v. Ehman , 2019 BCSC 2120 where they say the plaintiffs had similar injuries and were awarded more than $35,000 in damages. [12] The plaintiff filed an affidavit sworn December 13, 2019. In that affidavit, he deposes that, as a result of the accident, he continues to experience symptoms in his back, shoulders and right hip, and has difficulty sleeping. He complains of pain in his lower back and shoulders when not active, and of pain lasting two to three days if he engages in activities. He further deposed to having difficulty falling asleep and of waking in the night because of lower back pain. He further deposed to attending massage therapy on a more or less weekly basis and that he intends to seek chiropractic treatments. [13] In approaching this mater, I am particularly mindful of the caution expressed by Justice McEwan in Kooner v. Singh , 2011 BCSC 1384, at paras. 3 and 6. There, he stated it is only in the clearest of cases that a matter should be transferred to the Provincial Court. It is only where there is no possibility of a damage award exceeding the Small Claims\u2019 limit that a matter should be transferred to the Provincial Court: [3] I have commented on other occasions about these applications. They amount to the Supreme Court being asked to summarily determine that damages could not possibly exceed $25,000 and also to accept that a trial in Provincial Court is the most expeditious way to deal with the action. On the basis of the material before me, it is not possible to say that the case could not exceed $25,000. The plaintiff wishes to have the matter heard in Supreme Court, and it would only be on the clearest basis that the court would act to deprive a person who wished to be heard in the Supreme Court of the right to do so. \u2026 [6] I have said as much on the previous occasion of Chang v. Wren in oral reasons given June 10, 2011. I see no reason to stray from the outcome in that case which was to the effect that unless the court were persuaded that damages could not possibly exceed $25,000 the plaintiff should not be deprived of the opportunity to convince a court that their damages exceed that amount. I considered it most unsafe to summarily decide a case on the basis of descriptions that do not include the actual evidence of the parties. Courts certainly have the experience of being persuaded that cases that did not appear to be worth a great deal turn out to be worth much more once they have been heard. I will also say, as I said in Chang v. Wren, that I am absolutely not persuaded by any efficiency or cost-saving argument, particularly where, as here, the application is brought at a point post-discovery. There is very little process to avoid at this point and, for the reasons I have already indicated, it is not at all clear that there are cost savings to be realized. [14] The plaintiff is relatively young. He apparently had no medical issues prior to the accident. He apparently suffered soft tissue injuries in the accident to the neck, back and shoulders, and continues to suffer from what may be chronic pain which may encumber him for the rest of his life. He also has ongoing sleep difficulties and his injuries have affected his enjoyment of recreational activities. The injuries suffered by the plaintiff and the effects of those injuries are somewhat similar to what is described in Poulin and Carson , where the plaintiffs were awarded general damages of considerably in excess of $35,000. [15] In my view, on the basis of the evidence before me and the authorities, there is a possibility that the plaintiff may recover damages at trial in excess of $35,000. Accordingly, this matter should not be transferred to the Provincial Court, and the application is dismissed. [16] Costs, counsel? [17] MS. SEWELL: We would seek costs in any event, My Lord. [18] MS. CAREY: And our submission is costs in the cause, Your Honour. Or any such thing as you see fit. [19] THE COURT: Costs of this application shall be to the plaintiff. [20] MS. SEWELL: Can the costs be fixed, or should we deal with that later on? [21] THE COURT: You can deal with that at the trial, depending on how matters work out. I should make it clear that my costs order is, if the plaintiff recovers more than $35,000 at trial, that the plaintiff will be entitled to his costs of this application. [22] MS. SEWELL: Thank you, My Lord. [23] MS. CAREY: My Lord, if I may, can it be $35,000 at a settlement perhaps, and not just at trial, in case the matter settles before trial. [24] THE COURT: No, you can deal with that in your settlement if you decide to settle. [25] MS. CAREY: Thank you, My Lord. \u201cGiaschi J.\u201d",

Netherclift, 2019 BCCA 24 Date: 20190122 Docket: CA45208 Between: Lucy Hellberg Respondent (Claimant) And Simon Netherclift Appellant (Respondent) Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice Frankel The Honourable Mr. Justice Tysoe The Honourable Madam Justice Griffin Supplementary Reasons to: Hellberg v. Netherclift , 2018 BCCA 404. Counsel for the Appellant: S.G.L. Label Counsel for the Respondent: A.S. Perello Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British Columbia September 24, 2018 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia October 31, 2018 Written Submissions Received: November 15, 21 and 23, 2018 January 15, 2019 Date of Supplementary Judgment January 22, 2019 Supplementary Reasons of the Court Summary: After the appellant\u2019s appeal was dismissed, the respondent seeks special costs of the appeal proceedings and trial below. Held: Application for special costs dismissed. The central issue on appeal was whether the parties\u2019 child would primarily live with the respondent in the UK or with the appellant in Canada. The respondent did not cross appeal the ordinary costs order at the appeal, therefore , this Court will not interfere with that order. Further, the respondent has not established that the appellant misconducted himself in the conduct of this appeal. The respondent made a settlement offer but it was not unreasonable for the appellant to not accept it given the importance of the child\u2019s primary residence to the parties. The respondent is entitled to her costs of the appeal on a party and party basis. The appellant is entitled to costs of the application for special costs. Supplementary Reasons for Judgment of the Court: [1] These supplemental reasons concern whether this Court should award special costs in this Court and in the court below against the appellant, Mr. Netherclift, in favour of the successful respondent, Ms. Hellberg. [2] In our reasons for judgment in this appeal, indexed as 2018 BCCA 404, this Court dismissed Mr. Netherclift\u2019s appeal from the order of the trial judge, which: (1) granted Ms. Hellberg sole custody of the parties\u2019 child and permitted her to relocate permanently to the United Kingdom with the child; and (2) provided Mr. Netherclift joint guardianship and access to the child. [3] Ms. Hellberg now applies for a variety of costs orders, including orders that Mr. Netherclift pay special costs in relation to certain proceedings in this Court and the court below. She argues that special costs are justified because Mr. Netherclift misled this Court, in an earlier appeal, as to facts that went to the inquiry into the best interests of the child. [4] The trial judge below, in reasons indexed at 2018 BCSC 357, found Mr. Netherclift to have misled this Court but did not award special costs. Ms. Hellberg was entitled to her ordinary costs. [5] Ms. Hellberg did not cross appeal the costs award made at trial. [6] It is not for this Court to change a costs order made in the court below unless that issue was made an issue in this Court: Hill v. British Columbia (Minister of Forests) , 1999 BCCA 305 at para. 5. [7] As a result, the only question is whether we should depart from the usual costs order in the appeal we heard. [8] Mr. Netherclift\u2019s conduct of the appeal was not outrageous or scandalous. [9] The fact that this matter involved somewhat protracted litigation and gave rise to two appeals is not ideal. Considering the underlying facts, however, this case falls into the category of unfortunate as opposed to an abuse of process. [10] The central issue of where the parties\u2019 child might live was of vital importance to both parties. [11] Further, we find that Ms. Hellberg\u2019s offer to settle is not one that this Court should consider in awarding costs. Considering that her offer required the child to relocate to the UK, it was not unreasonable for Mr. Netherclift to oppose it. Both parties are good parents. Because of the parties\u2019 desire to live in different countries, their positions could not be easily resolved by compromise. [12] We do not consider that the evidence supports a conclusion that the usual rule as to costs will cause Mr. Netherclift hardship or that it will upset the balance between the parties. Nor would awarding party and party costs to Ms. Hellberg cause an unjust result to her. [13] In conclusion, we do not find any reason for departing from the usual order that costs follow the event. [14] Ms. Hellberg is therefore entitled to her costs of this appeal on a party and party basis and not as special costs. The trial costs order stands. [15] Finally, we order that Mr. Netherclift be granted costs in relation to this application to settle costs, given that Ms. Hellberg did not succeed in her application for special costs. \u201cThe Honourable Mr. Justice Frankel\u201d \u201cThe Honourable Mr. Justice Tysoe\u201d \u201cThe Honourable Madam Justice Griffin\u201d",

        "text": "COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA Citation: Genworth Financial Mortgage Insurance Company Canada v. Doan, 2020 BCCA 27 Date: 20200108 Docket: CA46332 Between: Genworth Financial Mortgage Insurance Company Canada Respondent (Petitioner) And Scott Lawson Doan Appellant (Respondent) Before: The Honourable Chief Justice Bauman The Honourable Mr. Justice Tysoe The Honourable Mr. Justice Abrioux On an application to vary: An order of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, dated October 18, 2019 ( Genworth Financial Mortgage Insurance Company of Canada v. Doan , 2019 BCCA 350, Vancouver Docket CA46332). Oral Reasons for Judgment Counsel for the Appellant: J.E. Shragge Counsel for the Respondent: R. Wilson M. Wilson Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British Columbia January 8, 2020 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia January 8, 2020 Summary: Application to vary an order made by a single justice in chambers that an order confirming a sale is a limited appeal order under R. 2.1 of the Court of Appeal Rules. Held: Application dismissed. The order was made under R. 21\u20117 of the Supreme Court Civil Rules [foreclosure and cancellation] even though an order absolute had been obtained in the foreclosure proceeding. [1] TYSOE J.A. : The applicant, Scott Lawson Doan, applies under s. 9(6) of the Court of Appeal Act , R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 77, to vary an order made by a single justice of this Court in chambers on October 18, 2019. The justice held that the order the applicant wishes to appeal is a limited appeal order under R. 2.1 of the Court of Appeal Rules , B.C. Reg. 297/2001, on the basis that it was granted under R. 21\u20117 [foreclosure and cancellation] of the Supreme Court Civil Rules , B.C. Reg. 168/2009. Mr. Doan therefore required leave of the Court to appeal the order, and the justice concluded that it was not in the interests of justice to grant leave. [2] The order which Mr. Doan wishes to appeal is an order made by Master Dick on July 24, 2019, approving a sale of property owned and occupied by Mr. Doan. The sale has completed and the property is now registered in the name of the third\u2011party purchaser. [3] The property was subject to a mortgage granted by Mr. Doan in favour of the Scotia Mortgage Corporation and insured by the respondent, Genworth Financial Mortgage Insurance Company Canada (\u201cGenworth Financial\u201d). Default was made under the mortgage in January 2016, and Scotia Mortgage Corporation commenced a foreclosure proceeding. On October 28, 2016, Scotia Mortgage Corporation obtained an order nisi , as well as an order for conduct of sale effective December 5, 2016. The amount required to redeem the mortgage at the time was approximately $174,000 plus interest at the approximate rate of 3%. [4] The property was listed for sale at a listing price of approximately $210,000. An offer of $170,000 was received, but it was not accepted. [5] In November 2016, Genworth Financial paid the amount owed to Scotia Mortgage Corporation and took an assignment of the mortgage and the foreclosure proceeding. On November 29, 2017, Genworth Financial was substituted as the petitioner in the foreclosure proceeding, and it also obtained an order absolute at the same time. Mr. Doan appealed the order absolute in the Supreme Court but, before the appeal was heard, the parties entered into an agreement dealing with the appeal and listing of the property for sale. [6] The agreement was contained in a letter dated July 3, 2018, from Genworth Financial\u2019s lawyer to Mr. Doan. It was agreed that Mr. Doan\u2019s appeal would be dismissed, that Mr. Doan would be entitled to list the property for sale for approximately three months and that, if an offer in an amount sufficient to pay off the mortgage was not received by September 30, 2018, Genworth Financial would \u201cproceed with listing the Property for sale under its conduct of sale order.\u201d The agreement also provided that if Mr. Doan did not cooperate with Genworth Financial\u2019s realtor or was in breach of other terms of the agreement, it would file the order absolute in the land title office. [7] No suitable offer was received by Mr. Doan, and Genworth Financial re\u2011listed the property for sale. It accepted an offer in the amount of $185,000 and applied within the foreclosure proceeding for court approval of the sale. [8] On July 24, 2019, Master Dick approved the sale at the $185,000 offered price. She noted that the property had been appraised to have a value of $205,000 as at April 30, 2019, but given the marketing history, she concluded that the offer was provident. Master Dick also noted that Mr. Doan would have to come up with close to $210,000 to retain the property. In light of the fact that Genworth Financial could not have sought to recover any shortfall from Mr. Doan if it had \u201cacted on the order absolute,\u201d Master Dick made it a term of the order approving the sale that Genworth Financial was barred from pursuing Mr. Doan on his personal covenant for any shortfall on the mortgage loan. [9] Mr. Doan filed a notice of application for leave to appeal, and the matter came on before the chambers judge on September 20, 2019. At the hearing, Mr. Doan took the position that leave to appeal was not required for three reasons, and if leave to appeal was required, it was an appropriate case for leave to be granted. [10] In reasons for judgment dated October 18, 2019, and indexed as 2019 BCCA 350, the chambers judge held that leave to appeal was required and that it was not in the interests of justice to grant leave. She rejected Mr. Doan\u2019s arguments that Master Dick\u2019s order was made under R. 13\u20115 [sales by the court] of the Supreme Court Civil Rules , rather than R. 21\u20117, because: (a) the foreclosure proceeding had come to an end when the order absolute was granted; (b) the sale was made pursuant to the letter agreement dated July 3, 2018; and (c) the notice of application for the order approving the sale stated that Genworth Financial was relying on R. 13\u20115 as well as R. 21\u20117. [11] The chambers judge went on to consider the usual factors for determining whether it was in the interests of justice to grant leave to appeal. She concluded that it was not in the interests of justice to grant leave because Mr. Doan had not provided evidence challenging the providence of the sale and any deficiency in the form of the evidence relied upon could be remedied upon a further application. She also considered it to be of great significance that title to the property had vested in a bona fide purchaser for value before Mr. Doan filed his notice of application for leave to appeal. [12] The standard of review on an application to vary or discharge an order of a justice under s. 9(6) of the Court of Appeal Act is well established. The division hearing the application will interfere with the decision of the chambers judge only if the judge was wrong in law, or wrong in principle, or misconceived the facts: Haldorson v. Coquitlam (City) , 2000 BCCA 672 at para. 7. [13] On this review application, Mr. Doan reiterates the first of his arguments that the order approving the sale could not have been made under R. 21\u20117 because the order absolute brought the foreclosure proceeding to an end and the court was functus officio. In that regard, he relies on decisions such as Federal Business Development Bank v. F.J.H. Construction Ltd. (1988), 50 D.L.R. (4th) 105 (B.C.C.A.), and Harrison v. Harrison , 2007 BCCA 120. [14] Mr. Doan says the chambers judge erred by rejecting this argument on the basis the proceeding is not at an end upon the granting of an order absolute because the mortgagor is still entitled to apply to reopen the foreclosure proceeding for the purpose of redeeming the mortgage. He submits that this is an exceptional equitable remedy which is available only to mortgagors and that Genworth Financial is not entitled to rely on it for the purpose of requiring leave to appeal to be obtained. [15] In my opinion, the flaw in Mr. Doan\u2019s argument is that he conflates the issue of whether the order was made in the foreclosure proceeding and the issue of whether the court should not have made the order for lack of jurisdiction. There can be no doubt that the order was made in the foreclosure proceeding. The application was made by Genworth Financial within the foreclosure proceeding pursuant to the order for conduct of sale granted in the foreclosure proceeding, and the order was made by Master Dick pursuant to that application. It is clear from Master Dick\u2019s reasons (dated July 24, 2019, and indexed as 2019 BCSC 1521) that she was exercising her power under R. 21\u20117(9) to confirm a sale on an application of a person having conduct of sale in a foreclosure proceeding. Whether she erred in exercising that power for lack of jurisdiction is a different issue. [16] There was no proceeding other than the foreclosure proceeding in which the order could have been made. Master Dick was not exercising the power of the court to vest title to the property in the purchaser under R. 13\u20115(7) in another proceeding because conduct of sale had not been granted in any other proceeding. [17] In determining whether the order was a limited appeal order, the issue is whether the order was granted under R. 21\u20117. It is not an issue, as Mr. Doan would have it, of whether the order should have been granted under R. 21\u20117. That latter issue goes to the merits of the appeal, not to the threshold issue of whether leave is required. [18] A somewhat analogous situation occurred in Mission Creek Mortgage Ltd. v. Angleland Holdings Inc. , 2013 BCCA 347. In that case, the appellant wished to appeal an order nisi on the basis that the foreclosure proceeding was null and void because notice had not been given under s. 21 of the Farm Debt Mediation Act , S.C. 1997, c. 21. This Court held that leave to appeal was required because the issue of whether the Supreme Court had the ability to make the order nisi was a matter that was determined under R. 21\u20117. As in the present case, the Court decided that the issue was whether the order was granted under R. 21\u20117, not whether the appellant had an argument that the Supreme Court did not have the jurisdiction to grant the order. [19] In my view, it is not necessary to address the arguments made by Genworth Financial that an order absolute is not a final order and that the letter agreement dated July 3, 2018, altered the effect of the order absolute. Nor is it necessary to consider whether leave to appeal should have been granted because Mr. Doan is not challenging the exercise of discretion by the chambers judge in refusing to grant leave, presumably because he is not able to point to any error made by her in the exercise of the discretion. [20] In conclusion, Mr. Doan has not demonstrated that the chambers judge erred in her conclusion that the order approving the sale was a limited appeal order within the meaning of R. 2.1. I would dismiss his application. [21] BAUMAN C.J.B.C. : I agree. [22] ABRIOUX J.A. : I agree. [23] BAUMAN C.J.B.C. : The application to vary is dismissed.

        "text": "IN THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA Citation: Enns v. Corbett, 2021 BCSC 2 Date: 20210104 Docket: M33169 Registry: Chilliwack Between: James Andrew David Enns Plaintiff And Jennifer Travis Corbett and Mark Eugene Gaudio Defendants Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice Riley Reasons for Judgment Re: Costs Counsel for the Plaintiff: D.R. Lester, Q.C. Counsel for the Defendants: I. Ferbey Dates of Written Submissions: November 23, 2020 December 15, 2020 December 16, 2020 Place and Date of Judgment: Chilliwack, B.C. January 4, 2021 [1] In reasons indexed as Enns v. Corbett , 2020 BCSC 1680, I granted judgment in the plaintiff\u2019s favour and awarded damages in the amount of $322,780.84 for personal injuries arising out of a motor vehicle collision. These are supplementary reasons for judgment dealing with costs. [2] The plaintiff asserts that as the successful party, he should receive costs of the action under Rule 14-1(9), and double costs from the date of a settlement offer made about three weeks before trial under Rule 9-1(5). The plaintiff says that even after allowing for potential deductions under s. 83 of the Insurance (Vehicle) Act , R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 231, the net amount awarded after trial is some $30,000 more than the amount proposed in his settlement offer. [3] For her part, the defendant concedes that the plaintiff is entitled to costs, but argues that this is not a proper case for double costs. The defendant disputes that the plaintiff\u2019s settlement offer \u201cought reasonably to have been accepted\u201d based on what was known at the time that it was open for acceptance. The defendant points out that the trial involved issues of both liability and quantum of damages. While the plaintiff ultimately succeeded in establishing liability, at the point when the offer was made there was room for debate regarding apportionment of liability as between the plaintiff and the defendant. [4] Rule 14-1(9) provides that the successful party is presumptively entitled to costs of the proceedings. [5] Rule 9-1 deals with the costs implications of an offer to settle. The overall purpose of this Rule is to encourage parties to seek early resolution by making settlement offers and to discourage parties from unreasonably refusing such offers. By encouraging settlement of claims at the earliest possible opportunity, the Rule provides a \u201cwinnowing function in the litigation process\u201d which requires litigants to come to grips with the relative strength or weakness of their respective claims and defences: Hartshorne v. Hartshorne , 2011 BCCA 29 at para. 25. [6] Rule 9-1(6) sets out a list of factors that may be taken into account in deciding what costs order to make where an offer to settle was made. I will review each of these factors as they apply to this case. [7] I do not agree with the plaintiff that the offer ought reasonably to have been accepted as contemplated in Rule 9-1(6)(a). Rather, I agree with the defendant that at the time the offer was made, there was uncertainty as to the strength of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, due in large measure to issues of contributory negligence and potential apportionment of liability. Despite the live issues as to liability, the plaintiff\u2019s offer expressly rested on the premise that the defendant would be found \u201cfully liable\u201d for the collision; it made no allowance for the contingent risk that the plaintiff might be found contributorily negligent, which was a live possibility based on the evidence available to the parties when the offer was made. To quote from the defendant\u2019s submission, the plaintiff\u2019s offer \u201cdid not account for the real risk that the plaintiff\u2019s claim might have been dismissed entirely or that liability might be apportioned, based on information available to the parties at the time\u201d. As explained in Owen v. Folster , 2019 BCSC 407 at para. 12, the plaintiff\u2019s offer did not put forward a \u201cgenuine compromise or an incentive to settle\u201d in view of the litigation risks, such that the defendant did not act unreasonably in declining to accept it. [8] I next consider the relationship between the terms of the offer and the amount of the final judgment as contemplated in Rule 9-1(6)(b). I agree with the defendant that while the plaintiff made an offer to settle for less than the amount ultimately awarded at trial, the difference was marginal by comparison to the overall damage award. Leaving aside costs of future care, the difference between the plaintiff\u2019s offer and the result at trial is some $30,000, which as a proportion is less than 15 percent of the total. This factor therefore does not weigh in the plaintiff\u2019s favour as much as it would if the gap were wider. [9] I must also consider the relative financial circumstances of the parties as provided for in Rule 9-1(6)(c). On the one hand, the very fact that the defendant had insurance coverage providing a greater capacity than the plaintiff to bear the financial risks of a trial is a relevant consideration in the costs analysis: Smith v. Tedford , 2010 BCCA 302 at para. 19. On the other hand, there is no evidence that the defendant or her insurer used their financial strength in an \u201cuntoward manner\u201d as discussed in C.P. v. RBC Life Insurance Company , 2015 BCCA 30 at para. 101-102. [10] On balance, the greater financial capacity of the defendant to assume the risks of a trial is a factor that weighs against the defendant\u2019s position on costs, but only marginally. In this regard, the cases cited by the plaintiff under this heading are distinguishable. In White v. Wang , 2015 BCSC 1080, liability was admitted, and there was evidence that the prospect of going to trial posed \u201can immediate financial risk to the plaintiff\u201d. In Vine v. Taylor , 2018 BCSC 105, liability was admitted, and the damages awarded at trial were some 2.5 times higher than an offer which the defendant ought reasonably to have accepted. [11] Neither party has cited any other considerations as contemplated in Rule 9-1(6)(d). [12] In my view, the most telling feature of this case is the fact that the offer to settle was premised on the plaintiff\u2019s position that the defendant would be found fully liable for the collision, when there were live issues as to apportionment of liability. In these circumstances, it cannot be said that the offer \u201cought reasonably to have been accepted\u201d. The other factors are less important in this particular case. The judgment obtained at trial was higher than the amount in the offer, but only marginally so as a proportion of the overall amount in issue. And, although the defendant\u2019s insurance coverage placed her at some degree of financial advantage in terms of the decision to proceed to trial, there is no evidence that the defendant or her insurer used their financial strength in an untoward manner. The plaintiff was successful at trial and is therefore entitled to costs of the action at Scale B, but not double costs. \u201cRiley J.\u201d",

        "text": "IN THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA Citation: Barter v. British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor   Vehicles),   2022 BCSC 51   Date: 20220113 Docket: S175907 Registry:  Vancouver Between: Dale Barter Petitioner And The Superintendent  of Motor Vehicles And The  Attorney General of British Columbia Respondents Corrected  Judgment: The text of the judgment was corrected at the front page and    the header on January 21, 2022. Before:  The Honourable Mr. Justice Mayer On  judicial review from: An amended decision of an adjudicator, Office of the  Superintendent of Motor Vehicles, dated June 28, 2017    re: Immediate Roadside Prohibition No. 21-6066165  Reasons for Judgment Counsel for the Petitioner: K.M. Lee Counsel for the Respondents: K. Hogg     M. Bennett Place and Date of Trial/Hearing: Vancouver, B.C. January 4, 2022 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, B.C. January 13, 2022   [1]     On July 13, 2016 the petitioner, Dale Barter, was issued a 90-day  immediate roadside prohibition (\u201cIRP\u201d) pursuant to s. 215.41 of the  Motor  Vehicle Act , R.S.B.C. 1998, c. 318 [ MVA ] on the basis that he  had failed, or refused without reasonable excuse, to comply with a demand to  provide a breath sample for analysis on an approved screening device (\u201cASD\u201d) to  police. A refusal to provide a breath sample results in the same penalty as a  \u201cFAIL\u201d reading on an ASD \u2013 that is, a reading that the driver\u2019s blood/alcohol  count is over the legal limit.  [2]     Mr. Barter\u2019s subsequent application to set aside the IRP was  refused by a delegate of the Superintendent of Motor Vehicles (the  \u201cAdjudicator\u201d) in an amended decision dated on June 28, 2017 (the \u201cDecision\u201d).  The Adjudicator found that Mr. Barter had deliberately, without reasonable  excuse, failed to provide a suitable breath sample.  [3]     In the application before me, Mr. Barter seeks an order that the  Decision be set aside and the matter remitted back to the Superintendent of Motor  Vehicles (the \u201cSuperintendent\u201d) for rehearing. Mr. Barter contends that  the Adjudicator made an unreasonable decision in finding that he had failed to  comply with a demand to provide a breath sample.  [4]     In the Decision the Adjudicator noted that because the evidence of Mr. Barter  and the police officer who issued the IRP was contradictory regarding the  efforts Mr. Barter had made to provide a breath sample, that it was  necessary to determine whose evidence was more credible.  [5]     The analysis of the Adjudicator on this issue is as follows:  Your evidence is that you were trying your best to provide a  proper breath sample. Before each attempt you took a deep breath and blew  genuinely for as long and hard as you could. You were provided with seven  opportunities to provide a suitable breath sample into the ASD and Officer Gunn  used more than one mouthpiece. You told Officer Gunn that you have asthma. You  indicate that you begged for another chance after the seventh attempt, but  Officer Gunn refused. Officer Gunn\u2019s evidence is that he gave you seven  opportunities to provide a breath sample and used three different mouthpieces. He  observed you walking, talking and breathing normally. He observed that you  would blow for a short time and then relax your grip on the mouthpiece with  your lips and then blow around the mouthpiece, rather than into it. He also  observed you blow for a short time and then inhale your breath. Officer Gunn  also indicates that he gave you the option of continuing to try with a  different mouthpiece or ASD and you stated, \u201cThe same thing will keep  happening\u201d. In determining which evidence is more credible, I have  considered the following: \u00b7     Having asthma, in and of itself, does not mean that you are  incapable of providing a suitable breath sample into an ASD. \u00b7     You have provided no medical evidence from your doctor to  indicate that your asthma precluded you from providing a proper breath sample  into the ASD. \u00b7     Other than telling Officer Gunn that you have asthma, you have provided  no evidence to indicate that you were suffering from the symptoms of asthma at  the time you were to provide a breath sample. In fact, in your affidavit you  state, \u201cI was blowing a long, hard, steady, and continuous blow into the  machine.\u201d \u00b7     I find your lack of asthmatic symptoms is supported by Officer  Gunn\u2019s evidence that you were talking and breathing normally. \u00b7     Although you indicate that Officer Gunn offered to take you for a  blood test at the hospital, I find this highly improbable. Officer Gunn made a  demand for a sample breath under section 254(2) of the  Criminal Code ; a  sample of blood may only be taken from a person pursuant to a demand made under  section 254(3). \u00b7     Providing a breath sample into an ASD is a simple act of inhaling  and then blowing into the mouthpiece for a few seconds until the ASD analyzes  the sample. Because I have found that the evidence supports that the ASD  that Officer Gunn used was functioning properly, I find that if you had blown  into the ASD as you describe in your affidavit, your breath would have been  analyzed by the ASD. In contrast, I find that your attempts to provide a breath  sample as described in detail in Officer Gunn\u2019s sworn evidence, would not have  resulted in an analysis by a properly functioning ASD. In considering the totality of  the evidence, I find that you have provided no persuasive evidence that would  lead me to conclude that you intended to provide a breath sample and that it  was your asthma or the unreliability of the ASD that precluded you from complying  with the demand. I find Officer Gunn\u2019s evidence that you deliberately failed to  provide a suitable breath sample into the ASD, more credible. In summary, I do  not find that you had a reasonable excuse for failing or refusing to comply  with the ASD demand. [6]     Section 215.48 of the  MVA  establishes the right of a person  served with an IRP to apply for a review before the Superintendent or their  delegate. Section 215.5(1) of the  MVA  prescribes that \u201cthe burden of  proof in a review of a driving prohibition under section 215.48 is on the  person on whom the notice of driving prohibition was served\u201d.  [7]     The parties agree that a reasonableness standard applies to the issues  on this review.  [8]     A reasonableness review requires the reviewing court to consider whether  the decision maker\u2019s reasoning is \u201cbased on an internally coherent and rational  chain of analysis and that is justified in relations to the facts and law that  constrain the decision maker\u201d:  Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  Immigration) v. Vavilov , 2019 SCC 65, at para. 85 [ Vavilov ].  [9]     In this application, in order to send this matter back to the  Superintendent for reconsideration, this Court must be satisfied that there are  shortcomings in the Decision which are sufficiently serious such that the  Decision does not exhibit the requisite degree of justification,  intelligibility and transparency. This Court must be satisfied that any alleged  shortcomings or flaws in the decision are sufficiently central or significant to  render the Decision unreasonable:  Vavilov,  at para. 100  [10]     This Court is not to reweigh and reassess the evidence considered by the  decision maker and must not interfere with findings of fact absent exceptional  circumstances:  Vavilov,  at para. 125.  [11]     In roadside driving prohibitions, credibility is frequently the central  issue. This Court should not substitute its own credibility findings for those  of an adjudicator. Reasons, which are flawed in one respect, must be considered  in their entirety in order to determine whether the flaw is central to the  decision:  Kenyon v. British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles),   2015 BCCA 485, at para. 55.  [12]     In order to overturn a credibility finding, this Court must find that  the petitioner has proven that the finding was made on evidence that was not  before the adjudicator or that the adjudicator failed to grapple with clear  material conflicts in the evidence:  Lemieux v. British Columbia  (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles),  2019 BCCA 230 at paras. 102 and  119 [ Lemieux ].  [13]     Where credibility is at issue, an  assessment of credibility involves examination of factors including, amongst  others, whether the witness\u2019 testimony seems unreasonable, impossible, or  unlikely:  Bradshaw v. Stenner,  2010 BCSC 1398,   at para. 186.   [14]     Mr. Barter contends that the Adjudicator\u2019s reasoning process was  unreasonable for the following reasons:  a)   The Adjudicator  failed to properly consider his evidence and considered irrelevant evidence in  assessing his credibility, being his statement made to police roadside that he  suffered from asthma.  b)   The evidence set  out in his unsworn affidavit provided in the IRP review, that \u201che was trying  his best\u201d to blow into the ASD, is not logically undermined by the fact that he  told the officer roadside that he had asthma.  c)   The  Adjudicator\u2019s determination that it was unlikely that the police officer  offered to take Mr. Barter to the hospital to provide a blood sample was  unreasonable as there was no evidence from the officer to contradict Mr. Barter\u2019s  evidence that such an offer was made.  d)   The  Adjudicator\u2019s statement that the act of providing a breath sample was simply to  inhale and then to blow into the ASD mouthpiece is not grounded in any evidence  before the Adjudicator.  e)   The  Adjudicator\u2019s conclusion that if Mr. Barter had blown into the ASD as he  described in his affidavit, that his breath would have been analyzed by the ASD  is an example of inappropriate \u201cbootstrap\u201d reasoning.  [15]     The Superintendent\u2019s position is that the Adjudicator\u2019s reasoning as set  out in the Decision is transparent, justifiable and intelligible and falls  within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes and is defensible in respect of  the facts and law.  [16]     In the Decision the Adjudicator quoted the evidence of the police  officer, summarizing his interaction with Mr. Barter on July 13, 2016 as  follows:  Despite walking, talking and  breathing normally, the driver would not provide a suitable sample of his  breath. The driver stated that he could not provide a sample due to asthma,  however was observed by Cst. GUNN to speak normally and walk normally without  strained breathing ... [17]     In his unsworn affidavit provided in the IRP review Mr. Barter did  not raise the issue of his asthma as a reasonable excuse for not providing a  suitable breath sample. He stated, in summary, that he made a genuine effort to  blow into the ASD for as long as he could, did not block the mouthpiece, blow  through his teeth, or blow in short spurts and that each time he attempted to  blow made a tight seal with his lips around the mouthpiece and blew a long,  hard, steady and continuous breath. He also stated in his unsworn affidavit  that there must have been something wrong with the ASD and its calibration  which kept it from accepting his breath sample.  [18]     In my view, the fact that Mr. Barter did not raise asthma as an  explanation for not providing a breath sample in the IRP review did not bar the  Adjudicator from considering his statement to police roadside in an assessment  of his credibility.  [19]     The circumstances in  Swick v. British Columbia (Superintendent of  Motor Vehicles),  2018 BCSC 1014 (affirmed in  Lemieux ) [ Swick ],  are similar to those before me in this judicial review. In  Swick  the  driver, Ms. Swick, was issued an IRP for refusing to provide a breath  sample and had told the officer that she was unable to do so due to a medical  issue that restricted her breathing. At the review before an adjudicator the  driver argued that the ASD must have malfunctioned.  Swick,  at para. 50.   [20]     Justice Duncan stated as follows at para. 53 of her decision in  Swick :   It was up to the adjudicator to  decide the extent to which the inconsistencies in Ms. Swick\u2019s statements  undermined her credibility and how that may affect whether or not she met the  burden of proof on review. This was not a case where the inconsistency was a  minor one or related to a tangential issue. The conflicting statements were  squarely concerned with whether or not Ms. Swick was truly attempting to  provide a breath sample, or whether some medical condition might have precluded  her from doing so. The adjudicator\u2019s finding that there was no way to  rationalize the two statements with a  bona fide  attempt to provide a  sample at roadside does not establish an unfair application of the burden of  proof. More accurately, it shows that Ms. Swick was unable to convince the  adjudicator on a balance of probabilities that her evidence should be preferred  over that of Constable Rekers. The adjudicator\u2019s decision in this regard was  justifiable, transparent and intelligible and clearly falls within a range of  reasonable acceptable outcomes. [21]     The Court of Appeal stated as follows at para. 101 of  Lemieux :   In the absence of a dispute of  the officer\u2019s evidence regarding what Ms. Swick said at roadside, it was open  to the adjudicator to accept the peace officer\u2019s evidence. It was then open to  the adjudicator to conclude that Ms. Swick\u2019s explanation at roadside belied her  affidavit evidence and to give reduced weight to her evidence.  [22]     I adopt the reasoning of Justice Duncan in  Swick  which was  affirmed by the Court of Appeal in  Lemieux.  [23]     The issue of whether or not Mr. Barter made a concerted effort to  blow into an ASD device or was unable to do so as a result of asthma was the  central issue to be determined by the Adjudicator. Mr. Barter does not  take issue with the evidence regarding his statements concerning asthma made to  police before the IRP was issued, which are inconsistent with the evidence in  his unsworn affidavit that he blew into the ASD mouthpiece long and hard and  had not relaxed his lips around the mouthpiece.  [24]     I find that in this case it was open and reasonable for the Adjudicator  to consider Mr. Barter\u2019s inconsistent excuses for his failure to provide a  breath sample in her assessment of his credibility.  [25]     Mr. Barter contends that there was no evidence on which the  Adjudicator could find, as she did, that it was unlikely that the officer  offered to take him to the hospital for a blood test \u2013 and therefore it was not  reasonable for her to discount his evidence that such an offer had been made in  assessing his credibility.  [26]     The Superintendent responds that it was not unreasonable for the  Adjudicator to determine that it was highly improbable that the officer had  offered to take Mr. Barter to the hospital for a blood test as blood tests  are not part of the IRP scheme.  [27]     I agree with Mr. Barter\u2019s submissions on this issue. Simply because  blood tests are not part of the IRP scheme does not lead to a reasonable  conclusion, in the absence of conflicting evidence, that the officer would not  have offered to take Mr. Barter to the hospital for a blood test.  [28]     I find, given the absence of conflicting evidence on this point, that it  was unreasonable for the Adjudicator to consider the issue of whether or not  police had offered to take Mr. Barter to the hospital for a blood test in  assessing his credibility. Despite this finding, I am not satisfied that the  Adjudicator placed sufficient weight on this portion of her credibility  assessment to make her conclusion on credibility unreasonable, in light of all  of the available evidence.  [29]     In my view, the focus of the Adjudicator\u2019s assessment of Mr. Barter\u2019s  credibility was on the evidence concerning his efforts to provide a breath  sample. The question of whether or not the officer offered to take Mr. Barter  for a blood test was not sufficiently central or significant to render the  Adjudicator\u2019s findings on credibility, and therefore the Decision,  unreasonable.  [30]     Mr. Barter contends that the Adjudicator ignored technical evidence  available to her, that factors including blowing at too low, too high, or an at  an inconsistent rate of flow impact ASD test results, and simply supplied her  own evidence that providing a breath sample involves a simple matter of  inhaling and blowing into an ASD.  [31]     I am not satisfied that the Adjudicator\u2019s generic description of the  process of blowing into an ASD mouthpiece to obtain an ASD test result was  wrong. In my view, the Adjudicator was simply briefly describing the  breathalyzer process in a general way, as one of the factors she considered in  determining Mr. Barter\u2019s credibility.  [32]     It appears that counsel for Mr. Barter asks this Court to conclude  that the Adjudicator somehow misinterpreted what was required in order for a  suitable breath sample to be obtained. I am not satisfied that this this is the  case. There was ample evidence before the Adjudicator with respect to the steps  that the officer took to obtain a suitable breath sample from Mr. Barter.  It was open to the Adjudicator to apply common sense and the evidence of the  officer in determining whether, in the absence of evidence that the ASD was  functioning properly, Mr. Barter had complied with the required breath  sampling process.  [33]     Mr. Barter contends that the Adjudicator\u2019s reasoning process, by  relying on the fact that a suitable sample was not obtained from the ASD to  conclude that he had refused to provide a suitable breath sample, was  unreasonable.  [34]     It is not surprising that Mr. Barter did not admit that he did not  blow into the mouthpiece in the manner described in the officer\u2019s evidence.  Again, Mr. Barter\u2019s evidence was that he made a tight seal with his lips around  the mouthpiece and blew a long, hard, steady and continuous breath into the ASD.  It was not unreasonable for the Adjudicator to conclude, given her finding that  the ASD was functioning properly, that Mr. Barter must not have been  blowing as he described and on this basis to infer, as it is apparent the  Adjudicator did, that he must have intended to do so.  [35]     On this basis, I do not find that the Adjudicator\u2019s finding that Mr. Barter  had not provided persuasive evidence that he intended to provide a breath  sample to be unreasonable.  [36]     As stated in  Vavilov , this Court  is not to reweigh and reassess the evidence considered by the adjudicator  absent and interfere with an adjudicator\u2019s findings of fact absent exceptional  circumstances. I do not consider that exceptional circumstances have been made  out in this judicial review.  [37]     I am satisfied that the  Adjudicator appropriately weighed the evidence, and made credibility findings  based on relevant evidence, with respect to whether or not Mr. Barter  intentionally failed to provide a breath sample.  [38]     As a result, I do not find the  decision of the Adjudicator dismissing Mr. Barter\u2019s review application in  respect of the IRP issued  July 13, 2016  to  be unreasonable.  [39]     Mr. Barter\u2019s petition is  dismissed, without costs to any party.  \u201cMayer J.\u201d",

        "text": "COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA Citation: Ahmed v. Canna Clinic Medicinal Society,   2019 BCCA 44 Date: 20190116 Docket: CA45263 Between: Jutta Ahmed Appellant (Plaintiff) And Canna Clinic  Medicinal Society Respondent (Defendant) Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice Harris The Honourable Madam Justice Stromberg-Stein The Honourable Madam Justice Fenlon On appeal from: An  order of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, dated   April 6, 2018 ( Ahmed v. Cannaclinic Medicinal Society , Vancouver Docket  S182842). Oral Reasons for Judgment The Appellant, appearing in person: J. Ahmed    with M. Ahmed Counsel for the Respondent: A. Sodagar Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 16, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 16, 2019   Summary: Ms. Ahmed appeals an  order dismissing her petition for judicial review of a Provincial Court  decision and awarding special costs against her. Held: appeal allowed in part.  The chambers judge did not err by exercising his discretion to dismiss Ms. Ahmed\u2019s  petition for judicial review based on her delay and the repetition of issues  raised and decided in previous court proceedings. However, the judge\u2019s order  awarding special costs against Ms. Ahmed is not supported by the reasons  for judgment, and accordingly must be set aside. [1]     FENLON J.A. : Ms. Ahmed is self-represented, although her  husband, Mohamed Ahmed, speaks on her behalf in court proceedings as he did  today. Ms. Ahmed says that the judge\u2019s decision not to allow her to  proceed with a judicial review of the Small Claims Court decision and ordering  special costs against her shows he was not exercising his discretion  reasonably, and did not understand that there is no time limit on a judicial  review. [2]     The dispute between Ms. Ahmed and the respondent Canna Clinic  Medicinal Society (\u201cCanna Clinic\u201d) has been long and fractious. Canna Clinic  leased premises Ms. Ahmed owns on Granville Street in Vancouver. The  leases started in March and September 2014 for three-year terms. Things got off  to a rocky start immediately as the landlord understood the tenant would be  operating a clothing store when in fact it was selling marihuana, apparently  without first obtaining city permits. [3]     Canna Clinic left the premises in July 2015 because, in its view, Ms. Ahmed  breached her obligations to provide quiet enjoyment. Ms. Ahmed commenced  two separate actions. The first was commenced in Small Claims Court. She sought  approximately $25,000 in damages for damage to the property. That action was  dismissed at a trial conference on April 19, 2017, because Ms. Ahmed had  failed to comply with orders made by the Small Claims Court to file and serve a  trial statement and to produce certain documents. On November 21, 2017, Madam  Justice Iyer of the Supreme Court of British Columbia dismissed Ms. Ahmed\u2019s  appeal from that decision. This Court declared Ms. Ahmed\u2019s notice of  appeal from Madam Justice Iyer\u2019s decision a nullity in reasons indexed as 2018  BCCA 114, because there is no right of appeal to this Court from a small claims  order. [4]     Ms. Ahmed then commenced a second action in B.C. Supreme Court,  again seeking damages for damage to the rental property left, she says, by Canna  Clinic and, in addition, $268,000 in unpaid rent to the end of the lease term. Canna  Clinic applied to dismiss the second action on the basis of cause of action  estoppel. On May 23, 2017, Mr. Justice Steeves made that order. His  decision was upheld by this Court in reasons indexed as 2018 BCCA 319. Put  simply, this Court found that Ms. Ahmed had made a strategic decision to  start in Small Claims Court and, having failed there, could not simply start  over in a different court, even if additional breaches of the lease were being  pursued. [5]     In the meantime, before this Court heard the appeal from Mr. Justice  Steeve\u2019s order, Ms. Ahmed applied to the Supreme Court for judicial review  of the April 2017 Provincial Court decision dismissing her action for $25,000  in damages. This amounted to the third time that she had attempted to litigate  the breaches of the lease she says Canna Clinic engaged in. The judge dismissed  Ms. Ahmed\u2019s petition for judicial review. Ms. Ahmed now appeals. [6]     In my view, the judge did not make a mistake in the way he exercised his  discretion. He was aware that there is no time limit for starting a judicial  review proceeding, saying so expressly at para. 5 of his reasons for  judgment. He decided that too much time had gone by and that was a decision  open to him. [7]     The judge also refused judicial review because the issues raised had  already been dealt with in other court proceedings and could not be challenged  again. That is the same reason this Court gave in dismissing Ms. Ahmed\u2019s  appeal to this Court last year:  Ahmed v. Canna Clinic,  2018 BCCA 319. The  judge made no error in his reasoning on this point. [8]     I see no merit in this part of the appeal. [9]     I turn now to Ms. Ahmed\u2019s submission that the judge made a mistake  in ordering special costs against her. I agree with that submission. [10]     The judge considered Canna Clinic\u2019s request for special costs and then  said: [9] THE COURT: Mr. Ahmed, I am not able to agree  with you and I hope you can take some lesson away from this, or your wife can,  or you both can. The courts are here to serve a function, which is to do  justice, but the courts are to do justice according to law, and the legal  process in this case has to come to an end, and that is where it ought to be  now. [10] I normally do what I  properly can to not award special costs against people who are unrepresented,  particularly when there is a lawyer on the other side, but I am ordering  special costs here, and I am doing it in accordance with these two cases that  have been cited. In both of them, you were the plaintiff. One was decided by  Madam Justice Fisher, as she then was, and the other by Mr. Justice  Willcock, as he then was. Your insults against the courts, the court  registries, and the judges cannot be accepted, and have to be punished with a  special costs order against you. [11]     It is clear from his reasons that the judge ordered special costs  against Mr. Ahmed, and yet the order provides that the petitioner, Ms. Ahmed,  is to pay special costs to Canna Clinic. This is a careless and troubling  mistake given that counsel obtained an order dispensing with Ms. Ahmed\u2019s  signature. Counsel in that position has a particular responsibility to submit  an order that accurately reflects the court\u2019s decision. It is also unfortunate  that the order was accepted and entered in the registry in a form that was not  consistent with the reasons. [12]     An appeal is from the order entered, and this order is not supported by  the judge\u2019s reasons for judgment and must be set aside. If the judge intended  to order that Mr. Ahmed pay special costs personally, he did not address  the considerations applicable to a costs order against a non-party. While such  an order could have been made, it appears the judge assumed Mr. Ahmed was  a party as he had been in the two previous cases to which the judge referred. In  these circumstances I would therefore set aside the order for special costs and  replace it with an order that Ms. Ahmed, as the unsuccessful party in the  court below, is to pay ordinary costs at Scale B to Canna Clinic. [13]     As for the costs of this appeal, success has been divided. In my view,  each party should bear their own costs.  [14]     HARRIS J.A. : I agree. [15]     STROMBERG-STEIN J.A. : I agree. [16]     HARRIS J.A. : The appeal is allowed to the extent that the order  of special costs is set aside and replaced with an order on the terms described  in Madam Justice Fenlon\u2019s reasons for judgment. Each party will bear their own  costs in this Court. [Discussion with Mr. Ahmed  re: seeking clarification] [17]     HARRIS J.A. : The reasons will be transcribed and made available  to you. You will then be able to understand clearly what it is we have ordered.  To summarize, we have ordered that each party will bear their own costs for  this appeal, so you do not have to pay anything in respect of that. Secondly,  insofar as the issue involving costs below from Mr. Justice Macintosh, the  order of special costs against Ms. Ahmed has been set aside. What she owes  are costs on the Party and Party Scale. \u201cThe  Honourable Madam Justice Fenlon\u201d",

        "text": "IN THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA Citation: Brewis v. British Columbia (Attorney General),   2020 BCSC 1293 Date: 20200107 Docket: S44652 Registry:  Penticton Between: William James  Brewis Petitioner And Attorney General  of BC, WSR Holdings ULC Inc & WCR Holdings ULC Inc Respondents   Before:  The Honourable Mr. Justice G.P. Weatherill   Oral Reasons for Judgment The Petitioner, appearing in person: W.J. Brewis Counsel for the Respondent Attorney General of BC: A.H. Dalmyn Counsel for the Respondents WSR Holdings ULC Inc and WCR   Holdings ULC Inc: J.D. Metherell Place and Date of Trial/Hearing: Penticton, B.C. January 7, 2020 Place and Date of Judgment: Penticton, B.C. January 7, 2020   [1]     THE COURT:  The petitioner, Mr. William James Brewis, filed  this petition on November 19, 2019 seeking, essentially, an interest in  property that is registered in the names of the respondents WSR Holdings ULC  Inc. and WCR Holdings ULC Inc. Mr. Brewis claims to be entitled to  ownership of those lands through a land trust that he claims is created by  operation of law. [2]     In his various written submissions that were filed and are contained  within a copious set of documents, in a trial binder of some 42 tabs, he states  the main issue in the petition is \u201cassumption of the continued acceptance to  the land trust and the legal status as tenant for life, which will continue to  be assumed as such until determined otherwise within the jurisdiction of a  judge or a senior court within English law\u201d. [3]     He says, \u201cThis requisition is for the court's determination based on the  doctrine of remitter, a redress that operates by operation of law to the land  trust as established by s. 16 of the  Settled Land Act 1925 \u201d. [4]     He then says a secondary issue is the determination of his past,  current, and future rights as settlor, with specific performance concerning the  duties and powers to the land trust in order to send a Supreme Court of B.C.  determination that justifies the notice already sent to those in possession of  the land trust assets who have failed to respond in regards to determining the  matter as required by the  Settled Land Act . [5]     He says he is the settlor of a trust of the subject properties, which he  now seeks to revoke. Those properties are owned by WSR Holdings ULC and WCR  Holdings ULC. They are registered owners under the  Land Title Act . [6]     He suggests that his claim involves established legal concepts such as  the common law; the  Settle Land Act , which is an English statute; and  that he has somehow become the settlor of a trust that he now wants to abandon.  He cites numerous legal authorities and case law, legislation, academic and  reference text, none of which apply to his argument. [7]     He has not satisfied me, even remotely, that he is the settlor of any  trust or, indeed, that there is any trust established in the first place. [8]     His submissions have no basis in law and simply make no sense. I am  amply satisfied that his arguments are in the nature of the methodologies  adopted by the Organized Pseudolegal Commercial Argument litigants, otherwise  known as OPCAs, as were discussed by Associate Chief Justice Rooke in  Meads  v. Meads , 2012 ABQB 571. [9]     His arguments distort and misapply recognized legal principles and  rules. They are illogical, incoherent, and delusional. They are wholly  rejected. Accordingly, the petition is dismissed. [10]     I note, from the response filed by WSR Holdings and WCR Holdings that  costs in the nature of special costs are being sought. [11]     Mr. Brewis swore an affidavit stating that he is age 46 and he is  of sound mind and body. I infer from that that he must have known this action  had no possible hope of success and was doomed from the outset. Its dismissal will  come as no surprise. He has been amply warned by, in particular, Mr. Dalmyn  on behalf of the Attorney General of British Columbia who succinctly and  clearly set out why his claim would fail in a letter addressed to Mr. Brewis  dated December 4, 2019. He simply chose to ignore the obvious. [12]     In my view, the petitioner\u2019s conduct, in bringing this illegitimate and ill-conceived  petition, is worthy of sanction, particularly as I have concluded that it was  brought in the nature of an OPCA claim, the concepts and schemes of which this  court and courts across Canada have consistently rejected. [13]     A special costs award that indemnifies an innocent party has merit where  that party faces the type of litigation the respondents faced here. It  satisfies the objectives of deterrence and punishment that would otherwise be  served by a punitive damage award. The misconduct in this case relates to the  fact that Mr. Brewis had no reasonable basis to commence or continue this  litigation. [14]     In my view, justice can only be done by an order for special costs. I  therefore order one set of special costs, payable by the petitioner to the  respondents WSR Holdings ULC Inc. and WCR Holdings ULC Inc. [15]     Special costs are being ordered not only as a sanction for the petition\u2019s  lack of merit but as a strong deterrent either to the petitioner or to others  who are of like mind from launching similar frivolous proceedings. The  petitioner must understand the consequences of these types of proceedings:  Dempsey  v. Envision Credit Union , 2006 BCSC 1324, at paras. 46 and 48; and  CIBC v. Marples, 2008 BCSC 590, at paras. 3, 4, and 7. [16]     Now, subject to any submissions from you, Mr. Dalmyn, I do not  propose to order costs payable to the Attorney General, because it is unusual  to do so in cases like this, but I will hear submissions if you wish. [17]     MR. DALMYN: I\u2019m not going to make a submission on that, My Lord.  The Attorney General, in administrative law cases and constitutional cases,  does not seek costs and is normally quite concerned when costs are sought  against the Attorney General. This is a hybrid case. The Attorney General\u2019s  appearance in this matter was necessitated by Mr. Brewis\u2019 very deep  misconceptions and wishful thinking about a solution to his poverty. It\u2019s not a  situation -- he wasted the time of correspondence unit and has wasted some of  my time, but that is one of the Attorney General\u2019s functions. [18]     THE COURT: All right. Well, thank you for that, Mr. Dalmyn. [19]     There will also be an order that the requirement that Mr. Brewis  sign the order I have made, which I will ask Ms. Metherell to draft, be  dispensed with. [20]     Anything further? [21]     MS. METHERELL: No, thank you, My Lord. [22]     THE COURT: Thank you both. We are adjourned. \u201cG.P. Weatherill J.\u201d",

Edge,   2021 BCCA 35 Date: 20210127 Docket: CA46315 Between: Regina Respondent And Peter Matthew Edge Appellant Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice Abrioux The Honourable Mr. Justice Grauer The Honourable Mr. Justice Voith On appeal from: An  order of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, dated   May 22, 2019 (conviction) and July 18, 2019 (sentence)   ( R. v. Edge , 2019 BCSC 1388, Vancouver Docket 27198-14).  The Appellant, appearing in person (via teleconference): P.M. Edge Counsel for the Respondent (via teleconference): S. Gillespie Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 18, 2021 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 27, 2021   Written Reasons by: The Honourable Mr. Justice Abrioux Concurred in by: The Honourable Mr. Justice Grauer The Honourable Mr. Justice Voith   Summary: In 2019 the appellant was  convicted of criminal harassment and uttering threats, and sentenced to 18  months\u2019 imprisonment (reduced to time served) and a three-year term of  probation. He applied to the Legal Services Society to fund an appeal. This was  denied for reasons other than financial ineligibility. He subsequently  initiated an appeal and, in June 2020, applied for court-appointed counsel  pursuant to s. 684 of the Criminal Code. His application was dismissed on  the basis that there was no merit to the appeal. He failed to attend two case  management hearings. The Associate Registrar then referred the matter to a  justice pursuant to Rule 13(3) of the Criminal Appeal Rules. The appellant  again failed to appear, and the justice referred the matter to a division of  the Court to consider whether to dismiss the appeal for want of prosecution. Held:  Appeal dismissed for want of prosecution. The appellant has not taken the  required steps to advance his appeal since his s. 684 application was  dismissed, nor indicated any intention to do so. He has not provided a  reasonable explanation for his inaction.  Reasons for Judgment of the Honourable  Mr. Justice Abrioux: [1]     This matter concerns a reference to the Court pursuant to Rule 13(3)  of the  British Columbia   Court of Appeal Criminal Appeal Rules, 1986,  B.C.  Reg. 145/86 [ Criminal Appeal Rules ]   whereby an order is  sought dismissing Mr. Edge\u2019s conviction and sentence appeals for want of  prosecution.  [2]     I will set out the pertinent background and appearances in this Court. [3]     On May 22, 2019, Justice Devlin (sitting with a jury) convicted the  appellant, who was self-represented at his trial, of criminal harassment of his  then-spouse, as well as uttering threats to cause death or bodily harm both to his  then-spouse and to his mother. On July 18, 2019, Devlin J. sentenced the  appellant to a total of 18 months\u2019 imprisonment (reduced to time served  due to extensive pre-trial custody) and a three-year term of probation. [4]     Following the imposition of sentence, the appellant applied to the Legal  Services Society (\u201cLSS\u201d) to fund his appeal. By letter dated June 25,  2020, the LSS denied the appellant\u2019s application for reasons other than  financial ineligibility. [5]     On August 19, 2019, Mr. Edge initiated an appeal in this Court  by filing a Notice of Appeal in which he alleged multiple grounds of appeal regarding  both conviction and sentence which include: \u00b7     the inherent unfairness of proceeding to trial while he was unrepresented,  which rendered the trial itself invalid such that a new trial is required; and \u00b7     ancillary grounds of appeal alleging malfeasance by various  justice system participants, including the police, Crown Counsel, and the trial  judge. [6]     On June 9, 2020, pursuant to s. 684 of the  Criminal Code ,  R.S.C. 1985, c. C\u201146, the appellant applied for counsel to be  appointed to represent him on the appeal. On July 24, 2020, his  application was dismissed in Chambers by Justice Dickson, on the basis that  there was no merit to his appeal. [7]     Following the dismissal of his s. 684 application, a case  management hearing was scheduled by teleconference for September 25, 2020.  Crown counsel attended, the appellant did not and the Court was unable to reach  him via telephone. By letter dated September 29, 2020, Crown counsel  advised Mr. Edge of the missed case management hearing and informed him of  the next appearance date, being a case management hearing scheduled for November 2,  2020. [8]     The appellant did not attend at that hearing. By letter dated November 3,  2020, Crown counsel advised Mr. Edge that no further appearances would be  scheduled until he took some action to proceed with his appeal, and should this  not occur by December 3, 2020, his appeal could be dismissed pursuant to  Rule 13(3) of the  Criminal Appeal Rules . [9]     By letter dated November 4, 2020, the Associate Registrar advised  the appellant that pursuant to Rule 13(3) of the  Criminal Appeal Rules , a  hearing date had been scheduled for December 3, 2020 at which time it  would be decided whether the appeal would be referred to the Court to be  dismissed. The appellant was provided with the requisite information to attend  the hearing by telephone. [10]     The appellant did not attend the December 3, 2020 hearing. Justice  Tysoe then referred the matter to proceed before a division of the Court to  consider whether the appeal should be dismissed for want of prosecution.  [11]     By letter dated December 3, 2020, Crown Counsel advised Mr. Edge  that if he declined to take further action, his appeal \u201cmay be dismissed for  want of prosecution pursuant to Rule 13 of the  Criminal Appeal Rules\u201d .   Crown Counsel also attempted to contact the appellant by telephone on  December 4, 2020, but was unable to reach him. [12]     By letter dated December 24, 2020, the Associate Registrar advised  the appellant that a referral to a division of the Court to consider dismissing  the appeal had been set for Monday, January 18, 2021 at 10:00 a.m. The  appellant was provided with the requisite information to attend the hearing by  telephone together with a Notice of Abandonment form should he wish to abandon  the appeal. [13]     The appellant appeared at the teleconference of January 18, 2021. [14]     The Crown\u2019s position was that the appellant had, as of January 18, 2021,  taken no action to move forward with his appeal since his s. 684  application was dismissed. He had not contacted the Crown nor the Registry to  indicate that he wished to proceed with his appeal. [15]     The Crown also pointed to the fact that Mr. Edge was provided with  notice of the case management conferences of September 25, 2020 and  November 2, 2020, and the December 3, 2020 hearing, and did not  attend on any of those occasions. [16]     The appellant\u2019s position was that he was unable and unwilling to  represent himself on the appeal. He argued that the Court had a responsibility to  instruct the LSS to provide him with legal counsel; if it did not do so then  the appeal \u201cwill have to wait\u201d, even if it might take \u201ca long time\u201d. He also  explained that his failure to move the appeal forward flowed from his  unemployment and lack of funds to order transcripts or take other steps in the  process. In that regard he says that there was no point in attending the  teleconferences and/or the hearing of December 3, 2020 since he did not  have counsel. [17]     The appellant has not taken the required steps to advance his appeal.  His s. 684 application was dismissed more than five months ago, and in the  intervening time he has neither filed the outstanding appeal materials nor  indicated any interest in pursuing his appeal in any practical way.  [18]     In light of the appellant\u2019s submissions, it must be emphasized that on  July 24, 2020, following an analysis of the alleged grounds of appeal of  both conviction and sentence, the s. 684 application was dismissed on the  basis that there was no merit to either appeal and the appointment of counsel  was not in the interests of justice. [19]     It is evident from the appellant\u2019s submissions that he has no plan to do  what is required to move the appeal forward. In my view he has also not provided  a reasonable explanation for what I consider to be a lengthy period of inaction,  which includes his failure to attend the teleconference hearings of September 25,  2020, November 2, 2020 and December 3, 2020. [20]     I would dismiss both the conviction appeal and the application for leave  to appeal sentence for want of prosecution. \u201cThe Honourable Mr. Justice  Abrioux\u201d I AGREE: \u201cThe  Honourable Mr. Justice Grauer\u201d I AGREE: \u201cThe  Honourable Mr. Justice Voith\u201d",

Delbeck , 2019 BCSC 1660, Vancouver Docket E171246).   Oral Reasons for Judgment Counsel for the Appellant: S.M. Armstrong Counsel for the Respondents: E.B. Clavier Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 20, 2020 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 22, 2020   Summary: The appellant seeks leave to  appeal an interim order granting the respondents contact time with his  children, who are their grandchildren. Held: Application dismissed. The  appellant has not shown that the disposition of this appeal would affect the  upcoming trial of this matter in any substantive way. Consequently, it is not  in the interests of justice for the appeal to proceed. [1]     GARSON J.A. : This is an application for leave to appeal an  interim order of the Supreme Court of British Columbia granting the respondents  contact with their grandchildren, pursuant to the provisions of the  Family  Law Act , S.B.C. 2011, c. 25 [ FLA ]. The application turns on  whether it is in the interests of justice to grant leave to appeal.  [2]     For the reasons given below, I have concluded that it is not in the  interests of justice to grant leave to appeal. As a result, the appellant\u2019s  application is dismissed. [3]     The appellant, Scott Delbeck, is the father of two children (the  \u201cchildren\u201d). The respondents, Cecilia and Ronald Gill (the \u201cGills\u201d), are the  maternal grandparents of the children. [4]     The children\u2019s mother died in November 2016. At that time, she and Mr. Delbeck  had been separated for approximately one year. The Gills were very involved in  the children\u2019s lives before and for some time after their mother\u2019s death.  [5]     In March 2017, Mr. Delbeck stopped allowing the Gills to have  contact with the children. In May 2017, the Gills filed a notice of family  claim in which they sought an order for contact. [6]     In August 2017, Mr. Delbeck advised the Gills that he planned to  move with the children to Denver for work purposes. That move occurred on  November 8, 2017. [7]     Before the Delbecks moved to Denver, two interim orders were made  respecting contact: one by consent at a judicial case conference on August 24,  2017, and the other following a contested application on November 3, 2017.  Those orders provided for periodic in\u2011person contact and regular contact  via Skype through the summer of 2018. The parties agreed to a further in\u2011person  visit in January 2019. [8]     On June 13, 2019, the Gills filed a notice of application seeking a  further interim order for contact. At the time the application was filed, the  children were living in Denver and were not physically present in British Columbia. [9]     In reasons indexed at 2019 BCSC 1660, Justice Fleming found that she had  jurisdiction to order contact under s. 74(2) of the  FLA . That  section provides: (2)  Despite any other provision of this Part,  a court  may make an order under this Part respecting guardianship, parenting  arrangements or contact with a child only if one of the following conditions is  met : (a)  the child is habitually resident in British Columbia  when the application is filed; (b)  the child is not habitually resident in British  Columbia when the application is filed, but the court is satisfied that (i)  the child is  physically present in British Columbia when the application is filed , (ii)  substantial  evidence concerning the best interests of the child is available in British Columbia, (iii)  no  application for an extraprovincial order is pending before an extraprovincial  tribunal in a place where the child is habitually resident, (iv)  no  extraprovincial order has been recognized by a court in British Columbia, (v)  the  child has a real and substantial connection with British Columbia, and (vi)  on  the balance of convenience, it is appropriate for jurisdiction to be exercised  in British Columbia; (c)  the child is physically present in British Columbia  and the court is satisfied that the child would suffer serious harm if the  child were to (i)  remain with, or be  returned to, the child's guardian, or (ii)  be  removed from British Columbia. [Emphasis added.] [10]     The chambers judge held that for the purposes of s. 74(2), an  \u201capplication is filed\u201d when the \u201cdocument that commences the claim for  guardianship, parenting arrangement[s] or contact is filed; in this case, the  notice of family claim\u201d: at para. 10. She determined that because the  children lived in the jurisdiction at the time the notice of family claim was  filed, the court was entitled to make an interim order respecting contact. [11]     The chambers judge further concluded that an order for contact was  appropriate in this case. She made an order that allowed the Gills to exercise  in\u2011person contact for four days in Colorado during the children\u2019s  2019\u20132020 winter break and for ten days in Vancouver during the children\u2019s 2020  summer break. The order also provided for weekly 15\u2011minute Skype calls. [12]     Mr. Delbeck seeks leave to appeal the chambers judge\u2019s order. He  alleges that she erred in her interpretation of s. 74(2) of the  FLA   and was without jurisdiction to make an interim order for contact when the  children resided in Denver. He says the word \u201capplication\u201d in s. 74(2)(b)  refers to the notice of application that is the actual notice seeking the  interim order, filed, in this case, long after the children had moved to  Denver, not the initiating pleading that commenced the family claim.  Accordingly, he says the chambers judge lacked jurisdiction to make an order  under s. 74(2)(b) because the children were not physically present in  British Columbia when the application was filed. [13]     The Gills say there is no merit to the appeal and no merit to the  application for leave. In particular, they say there is no utility to the  parties in this appeal because the jurisdictional question will not arise at  the trial and, therefore, the appeal will have little impact on the child care  arrangements. [14]     The trial of the action is set to proceed in September 2020. [15]     An appeal to the Court does not lie from a limited appeal order without  the leave of a justice:  Court of Appeal Act , R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 77,  s. 7(2). Orders granting interim relief under the  FLA  are limited  appeal orders:  Court of Appeal Rules , R. 2.1(c). [16]     In  Goldman, Sachs & Co. v. Sessions , 2000 BCCA 326 at para. 10  (Chambers), Justice Saunders explained that the criteria for granting leave to  appeal include: [1]   whether  the point on appeal is of significance to the practice; [2] whether the point raised is of significance to the  action itself; [3] whether  the appeal is prima facie meritorious or, on the other hand, whether it is  frivolous; and [4] whether the appeal  will unduly hinder the progress of the action. [17]     The criteria for leave are \u201call considered under the rubric of  the interests of justice\u201d:  Vancouver (City) v. Zhang , 2007 BCCA 280 at para. 10  (Chambers). Even where the four criteria listed above are met, leave may be  denied if it would not be in the interests of justice for the appeal to  proceed:  Movassaghi v. Aghtai,  2010 BCCA 175 at para. 27 (Chambers). [18]     The party seeking leave to appeal bears the onus of establishing that  the test for leave has been met:  B.C. Teachers\u2019 Federation v. B.C. (Attorney  General)  (1986), 4 B.C.L.R. (2d) 8 (C.A.) at 11 (Chambers).  [19]     In oral argument, counsel for Mr. Delbeck did not contest the  Gills\u2019 submission that the outcome of the appeal is irrelevant to the ultimate  disposition of this action. Consequently, I accept that characterization is  accurate. As I have said, the trial is to determine the final order and the  relevant pleading is the originating family claim. Accordingly, the question of  jurisdiction that Mr. Delbeck says arises on the interim application will  not arise in the trial. [20]     The sole effect of this appeal as it relates to the parties themselves  would be to determine whether the Gills are entitled to the interim contact.  That contact includes one ten\u2011day visit over the summer holidays and  weekly Skype calls. Depending on the timing of the appeal, reasons may or may  not be available prior to the summer visit. [21]     As stated in  Munro v. Munro , 2015 BCCA 530 at para. 18  (Chambers), the \u201cvalues of efficiency and proportionality are relevant to the  interests of justice.\u201d The question is whether the potential benefit of a  successful appeal justifies the expense that both parties will incur if it  proceeds, given that the appeal will have no effect on the final order made at  trial. In my view, it does not. [22]     Mr. Delbeck\u2019s proposed ground of appeal is arguable and may be of  importance to the practice. However, in this case, and for these parties, the  interests of justice favours resolution by trial without an intervening and  costly appeal, particularly where the trial is only eight months away.  Moreover, as I have said, the appeal is only relevant to the interim order and  will not advance the disposition of the underlying dispute. [23]     For these reasons, I dismiss the application for leave to appeal with  costs. \u201cThe  Honourable Madam Justice Garson\u201d",

[2]     The plaintiff claims damages for the professional negligence of the  defendant mortgage broker and its principal who he alleges provided him with a  property appraisal upon which he relied to provide third mortgage property  financing. The property was subsequently foreclosed. The plaintiff says he  never would have loaned the moneys but for the appraisal and alleges that he  lost approximately $202,000 as a result. [3]     The appraisal in issue is dated February 2, 2012 and was prepared by a  company called Canadian Home Appraisals. It was not for the plaintiff but  rather for an entity called Verico Select Mortgages (\u201cVerico\u201d) and its  principal J. McLean. Although I have yet to hear evidence on the point, I  assume that Verico was an unrelated prospective private mortgage financing firm  and J. McLean was a principal at Verico. A copy of the appraisal was obtained  by the defendants (I believe from an independent mortgage brokerage firm called  \u201cCanadian Mortgage Strategies & Investments\u201d although I have yet to be  provided with any confirmatory evidence) and was provided by the defendants to  the plaintiff on April 5, 2012, approximately five weeks prior to him advancing  the third mortgage financing in question. [4]     The parties are in agreement that the appraisal valued the property  significantly higher than its actual market value at the time and that, for the  purpose of trial, was prepared negligently. The plaintiff originally named  Canadian Home Appraisals, its principal, Jeff Pokoroka, and the author of the  appraisal, Kevin Janzen, as defendants. However, the action was discontinued  against them because it was determined by plaintiff\u2019s counsel that the limit of  liability and waiver language contained in the appraisal precluded an action  against them. [5]     Fundamental to the plaintiff\u2019s case against the remaining defendants,  namely the mortgage brokerage firm and its principal, is the assertion that  they breached the standard of care expected of them in the circumstances. In  particular, the plaintiff alleges that the defendants had a duty to and failed: a)   to recommend  that the plaintiff obtain his own appraisal of the property before providing  mortgage financing; and/or b)   failed to advise  the plaintiff to obtain what is called a Letter of Transmittal from the author  of the appraisal before using and relying upon it. [6]     The plaintiff served and proposes to rely at trial upon the expert  report of John Ribalkin, an experienced mortgage broker. While the defendants  do not object to Mr. Ribalkin\u2019s qualifications and experience, they do object  to the admissibility of the report itself. Their principle objection is that  the opinions Mr. Ribalkin purports to express are an attempt to usurp the  function of the trial judge. [7]     I have read Mr. Ribalkin\u2019s report which, excluding its voluminous  attachments, is a relatively short 4 pages. [8]     Mr. Ribalkin begins his report by properly setting out his duty under  Rule 11-2 of the  Supreme Court Civil Rules , followed by a listing of the  documents he was provided by plaintiff\u2019s counsel and upon which he has relied  for his report. He then exhibits and comments upon various information  bulletins published online by the British Columbia Financial Institutions  Commission Registrar of Mortgage Brokers that were in existence at the relevant  time as support for his opinion regarding a mortgage broker\u2019s duty of care when  supplying a property appraisal to a potential investor. The Financial  Institutions Commission administers the  Mortgage Brokers Act  of British  Columbia, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 313 [ Act ]. Mr. Ribalkin also refers to  various regulations passed under the  Act . [9]     After reading the definition of \u201cSophisticated Person\u201d as set out in the  regulations, Mr. Ribalkin opines that the plaintiff \u201cis not in my opinion a  \u2018Sophisticated Person\u2019 as defined in these regulations\u201d. [10]     After then stating and/or interpreting various provisions of the  Act   regarding the statutory duties owed by mortgage brokers, Mr. Ribalkin states  that \u201cIn this mortgage transaction \u2018Sadler\u2019 in my opinion was acting on behalf  of \u2018Bryce\u2019\u201d. [11]     Then, having read on the face of the appraisal that it had been  addressed to Verico\u2013J. McLean, Mr. Ribalkin states that \u201c\u2026therefore \u2018McLean\u2019  was the only party that could rely on this appraisal\u201d. He goes on to state  that: For another party or lender to  rely on this appraisal then a Letter of Transmittal (hereinafter referred to as  \u201cLOT\u201d) has to be obtained from the appraisal firm so that the lender, in this  case \u201cBryce\u201d, is then by the \u201cLOT\u201d has [sic] gained ownership of the report and  can then rely on it to make a lending decision. Without a \u201cLOT\u201d this  [appraisal] has no value to \u201cBryce\u201d whatsoever. [12]     Mr. Ribalkin states that the defendants \u201cshould have advised \u201cBryce\u201d  that to rely on that appraisal report that [ sic ] a \u201cLOT\u201d would have to  be obtained or \u201cBryce\u201d would have to procure another appraisal addressed  directly to him that he could rely on for lending purposes\u201d. [13]     Mr. Ribalkin then states: I have read through all the documents as supplied to me by  [plaintiff\u2019s counsel] and I see no declaration from \u201cSadler\u201d to \u201cBryce\u201d that he  should obtain a \u201cLOT\u201d to be able to rely on the appraisal\u2026 This is a basic  standard of care that a Mortgage Broker should do for a lender.  [Emphasis  added.] (the \u201cStandard of Care Opinion\u201d). [14]     Mr. Ribalkin then pontificates about how best a lender can recover an  investment in the case of default, including through the means of foreclosure  or Errors and Omissions Insurance that \u201call appraisal companies and their  employees carry to cover their work\u201d. [15]     Finally, Mr. Ribalkin states that: Seeing no \u201cLOT\u201d, seeing no  declaration from \u201cSadler\u201d to \u201cBryce\u201d that without the \u201cLOT\u201d or a new appraisal  the appraisal that was included in the [Investor/Lender Disclosure Statement]  prepared by \u201cSadler\u201d had no value to \u201cBryce\u201d. In my opinion, \u201cSadler\u201d by not  obtaining a \u201cLOT\u201d for the lender or advising the lender to obtain his own \u201cLOT\u201d  or advising the lender to obtain a new appraisal he could rely upon failed in  his Duty of Care to \u201cBryce\u201d. [16]     The role of an expert is to assist the court by providing an impartial  and objective opinion on matters outside the experience and knowledge of the  trier of fact:  Royce Holdings Inc. v. Jupe , 2018 BCSC 2025 at para. 81. [17]     It is not the function of an expert in court proceedings to simply  regurgitate plain language he or she has read in text books, periodicals or, as  in this case, in a statute and regulations and related bulletins, and them  simply opine on the outcome of a case based upon those readings. Such  postulations are neither necessary nor relevant. The court is fully capable of  reading and understanding such passages. [18]     It is even more improper for an expert to usurp the function of the  court in a negligence case by opining that a party has breached a duty of  care. That is for the trier of fact to determine, not an expert. [19]     Mr. Ribalkin\u2019s report is flawed in all of these respects. [20]     As was stated by this court in  CMC Engineering and Management Limited  v. Pinnacle Renewable Energy Inc. , 2018 BCSC 2457 at para. 13(g), in  exercising my gatekeeping function, I may take into account that I am sitting  without a jury and am able to disregard shortcomings in the phrasing of the  expert report that might be problematic if the trier of fact was a jury. [21]     I find that Mr. Ribalkin\u2019s report is admissible to the extent that it  provides an opinion as to the standard of care expected of a mortgage broker by  the industry in the circumstances of this case. The only place in his report  that he does so is in the passage quoted at para. 13 above. However, I am  satisfied that, in exercising my gatekeeping function, I am able to disregard  the shortcomings in phraseology used by Mr. Ribalkin in the final sentence of  his report and give his opinion set out in that sentence the appropriate weight  on the basis and only on the basis that the sentence is amended to read as  follows, which I find is effectively what Mr. Ribalkin was attempting to  convey: In my opinion, before making use of an appraisal prepared for  a third party, it was standard practice in the mortgage brokerage industry for  a mortgage broker to first: (a)     obtain an \u201cLOT\u201d; (b)     advise the lender to obtain an \u201cLOT\u201d; or (c)     advise the lender to obtain his own appraisal. [22]     The balance of the opinions set out in the report are inadmissible.   Specifically, the portions of the report from the last paragraph at the bottom  of page 2 to the end of the report are inadmissible with the exception of the  Standard of Care Opinion and the final sentence as I have reformulated it. \u201cG.C.

Rostami , 2018 BCSC 681, Kelowna Docket  E103131). Oral Reasons for Judgment The Appellant Cyrous Sharifpour, appearing in person: C. Sharifpour The Respondent Parisa Rostami, appearing via   teleconference: P. Rostami Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British   Columbia February 4, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British   Columbia February 4, 2019   Summary: The appellant seeks an order  waiving the requirement that the appellant must file a transcript of the trial  testimony. Held: Application dismissed. The appellant is given leave to amend  his factum by February 28 to reduce the need for a full transcript. Any issues  concerning the contents of the transcript following such amendment are referred  to the registrar for settlement. The time for filing the respondent\u2019s factum  does not begin to run until the contents of the transcript have been settled. [1]     HUNTER J.A. : The appellant in what the trial judge described as acrimonious  matrimonial proceedings applies for an order waiving the requirement that he  file a transcript of the trial evidence. The trial extended over 19 days and  the appellant has been given an estimate of $20,000 for the transcript. He  advises that he cannot afford to pay this sum, and says that he does not intend  to rely on the oral testimony from the trial, but on the documentary evidence  he has filed and prepared. Both he and the respondent are acting on their own  behalf. [2]     The requirement to file a transcript is statutory. Section 16 of the  Court  of Appeal Act,  R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 77,   requires that the  appellant must file an appeal book and a transcript in accordance with the  Court\u2019s rules. Rule 20(1) of the  Court of Appeal Rules,  B.C. Reg.  297/2001   sets out this requirement in greater detail: 20 (1) If oral testimony was presented in the court appealed  from, the appellant must, within 60 days after bringing the appeal, a) obtain a transcript of the oral  testimony, b) file one paper copy of that  transcript for use by the court plus such additional paper copies as are  required for the purposes of paragraph (d), c) file one electronic copy of the  transcript, d) serve one filed paper copy of  the transcript on each of the other parties, and e) serve on each party who requests it an electronic copy of  the transcript. [3]     While only one copy of the paper transcript need be filed with the  Court, the parties must also file four copies of a transcript extract book  containing any portions of the oral testimony relied upon in that party\u2019s  factum: Rule 27. [4]     The Court is aware that the cost of a transcript can be an impediment to  bringing an appeal, and the Court\u2019s rules provide two mechanisms for reducing  that burden. A single justice such as myself may exclude any testimony from the  transcript in accordance with Rule 20(5), and the registrar of the Court has  the authority under Rule 26.1 to settle the contents of the transcript. [5]     Registrar Outerbridge has reviewed the considerations that affect the  exclusion of portions of the transcript in  Foote v. Canada Revenue Agency ,  2016 BCCA 188. As he noted, the purpose of requiring a transcript of the  evidence is to ensure that the Court will have a proper record of the  proceedings from which appeals are taken:  Pavlis v. HSBC Bank Canada ,  2009 BCCA 450 at para. 8. [6]     Depending on the issues to be addressed in the appeal, it may be  possible to reduce the bulk of the transcript that is required, and even to  eliminate the need for a transcript of the evidence, although it is seldom that  an appeal is framed so narrowly that no transcript at all is required. [7]     The appellant\u2019s statement that he does not intend to rely on the oral  evidence from the trial is not relevant to the question of excluding evidence  from the transcript. What is significant is the manner in which the appeal is  framed, and whether recourse to the oral evidence may be required by the Court  in its consideration of the appeal. Registrar Outerbridge addressed this issue  in this way in  Foote : [12] It is a misconception that an appellant need only  obtain those portions of the transcript that are necessary to advance arguments  within their factum and then leave a respondent to obtain whatever else they  require at their expense. This position was taken by the appellants at the  appointment.  [13] The appellants\u2019  responsibility, as noted in  Pavlis , is to ensure the transcript is  sufficient to allow an appeal to be considered in its proper context. They are  charged with the responsibility and expense of obtaining the transcript in the  discharge of that obligation, given it is their appeal. Where there is a  dispute or the parties are unsure, they may settle the transcript before the  Registrar or limit the contents of the transcript before a Justice. [8]     In this appeal, there is no possibility of hearing the appeal as it is  being advanced by the appellant without recourse to the evidence at trial. This  conclusion flows from the issues the appellant wishes to canvas on appeal. The  notice of appeal, for example, lists 17 grounds for appeal, virtually all of  which are allegations of error in the manner in which the trial judge treated  the evidence. The appellant has filed his factum, and Part 2 of the factum  identifies 18 allegations of error by the trial judge. The allegations are  framed almost entirely in terms of the judge\u2019s assessment of the evidence,  including allegations such as the trial judge \u201ccommitted a palpable error in  finding that\u2026\u201d, \u201c\u2026failed to adequately consider the evidence that\u2026\u201d, \u201cerred on  the evidence that\u2026\u201d, and \u201cerred on the evidence and committed a palpable error  in finding that\u2026\u201d. [9]     In an earlier judgment concerning the filing of appeal books and factum,  Justice Garson described this proceeding as \u201ca fact-intensive, complicated  trial\u201d: 2018 BCCA 397 (Chambers) at para. 14. I agree with that  characterization. It is perhaps inevitable than an appeal of such a trial will  be laden with allegations of factual error. But that is the kind of appeal  where a transcript is most necessary. [10]     Justice Saunders recently dealt with a similar application in  Agent E  v. Canada (Attorney General),  2018 BCCA 492 (Chambers), review dismissed  2018 BCCA 491. In considering the need for a full transcript, Saunders J.A.  referred with approval to the judgment in  Brazeau v. International  Brotherhood of Electrical Workers , 2004 BCCA 333, in which Justice Low made  these comments: [5] In most appeals the panel members hearing the  appeal will wish to have the evidence given by the witnesses available to them.  In the present case the appellant argues that no transcripts are necessary  because the basis of the appeal is that the trial judge erred in applying the  law as to the facts that she found and which are now undisputed. Although this  position is attractive in the interests of lessening the volume of the record,  I am not persuaded that the court will not need the transcripts. [6] I confess that I am approaching the issue  cautiously, but this is a fact-rich case, and I can foresee that members of the  panel hearing this appeal will likely wish to have access to the evidence to  learn the context in which significant findings of fact were made,  notwithstanding that those findings of fact are not in dispute. [7] It is not enough, in  my opinion, to dispense with transcripts simply because it is not contended  that the trial judge made any factual errors by misapprehending the evidence or  disregarding important evidence therefore making a palpable and overriding  error. [11]     This case also is a fact-rich case. Unlike the  Brazeau  judgment,  the appellant in this case does contend that the trial judge made factual  errors by misapprehending or disregarding important evidence. As presently  framed, this appeal requires a full transcript to be filed. I am not prepared  to waive the requirement of a transcript. [12]     It may be possible to revise the factum in such a way as to identify  legal issues that do not require a full factual record. I am skeptical that  this can be done without the assistance of counsel, but I am prepared to give  the appellant leave to file an amended factum if he wishes to try to reframe  the appeal in such a way that the appeal is based on legal issues arising from  the trial judge\u2019s judgment and not purely factual matters. If he wishes to do  so, he may file an amended factum no later than February 28, 2019. I strongly  recommend that both parties seek legal assistance in the preparation of their  factums.  [13]     If the appellant elects not to file an amended factum by February 28,  2019, the application to waive the requirement of filing a transcript of all  the oral evidence presented at trial will stand dismissed. [14]     If the appellant does file an amended factum but the parties still  cannot agree on any exclusions from the evidence required to be included in the  transcript, I direct that the contents of the transcript be settled by the  registrar pursuant to Rule 26.1. Until this has been done, this appeal cannot  proceed. The time for filing a respondent\u2019s factum will be extended, and will  not begin to run until a transcript either agreed upon by the parties or  settled by the registrar has been filed and served. The time for filing the  respondent\u2019s appeal book will be extended in the same way. [15]     Accordingly, I make the following order: (i) the appellant\u2019s application for an order waiving  the requirement to file a transcript of the oral testimony presented at the  trial is dismissed; (ii) the appellant has leave  to file an amended factum no later than February 28, 2019; (iii) if the appellant does file an amended factum and  the parties still are unable to agree on exclusions from the transcript, the  contents of the transcript are to be settled before the registrar; (iv) the time limits for the filing of the respondent\u2019s  factum and appeal book will not begin to run until a transcript either agreed  upon by the parties or settled by the registrar has been filed and served; (v) until the determination of the need to file a full  transcript or a transcript with exclusions of evidence has been resolved,  either by agreement of the parties or by settlement by the registrar, this  appeal cannot be set down for hearing; and (vi) the respondent is entitled to her costs of this  application. \u201cThe Honourable Mr. Justice Hunter\u201d",

        "text": "IN THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA Citation: Drummond v. Powell River (City),   2019 BCSC 92 Date: 20190108 Docket: S2707 Registry:  Powell River In  the Matter of an Application Pursuant to   Section 153 of the  Local Government Act Between: Allan Keith  Drummond Petitioner And City of Powell  River Respondent Before:  The Honourable Mr. Justice Groves Oral Reasons for Judgment   In  Chambers Counsel for the Petitioner: F.G. Reif Counsel for the Respondent: A. Carricato An interested party, appearing on his own behalf: George Doubt Place and Date of Trial/Hearing: Vancouver, B.C. January 8, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, B.C. January 8, 2019   [1]     THE COURT:  This is my decision on the matter of Allan Keith  Drummond and the City of Powell River. [2]     In this petition filed pursuant to the  Local Government Act , R.S.B.C.  2015, c. 1, the petitioner applies by way of petition for the following  relief, namely an order that the official results regarding two candidates,  being Allan Drummond and George Doubt, in the civic election held in Powell  River on the 20th of October, 2018, be declared invalid and that the election  of the city councillor George Doubt be annulled. Further, it seeks a  declaration that the chief electoral officer of the City of Powell River  declare the results of the election invalid. [3]     As indicated in the prayers for relief, municipal elections were held in  the City of Powell River, as they were throughout the province, on the 20th of  October, 2018. Specifically in Powell River, the municipal election was for,  amongst other things, the position of mayor and six positions as city  councillor. As a result of the election on that date, the sixth place council  position was awarded to George Doubt, who is an interested party who appeared  on this matter. Mr. Doubt, in the official results of the municipal election in  the City of Powell River, received 1,766 votes. [4]     I should add here that Mr. Doubt, as an interested party, spoke and  provided articulate reasons for his view as to why the petition should not be  granted. [5]     The seventh place result holder after the October 20, 2018 municipal  election was Allan Keith Drummond, the petitioner. Mr. Drummond received 1,764  votes, or two votes less than Mr. Doubt.  [6]     After the results of this very close election were made public, it  appears from the evidence before me that the CEO of the City of Powell River  did a sample audit of some sort, which did not result in any concerns being  raised. [7]     The petitioner, Allan Keith Drummond, did his own internal investigation  and analysis of those persons who cast votes in the election. The petitioner  states in the petition that he uncovered, through this analysis, six persons  who indicated a civic address to vote on their voter registration which was  outside the municipal boundaries of the City of Powell River, making them, in  his view, ineligible to vote. It is not disputed by anyone that, in fact, there  are six people who have indicated in their voter registration an address  outside the City of Powell River, and that they in fact voted. They gave on  their registration a residential address outside of the boundaries of Powell  River. [8]     But being a resident is not the only basis on which a person is entitled  to vote. In fact, subsequent investigation by the CEO of the City of Powell  River determined, it appears, that two of those six people who listed addresses  outside of the municipal boundaries of Powell River, were in fact owners of  real property or land within the City of Powell River and, as such, were  eligible to vote. That left four people who voted who the petitioner claims  were  prima facie  not eligible to vote. [9]     I should have said earlier, but will say here, that it is my  understanding that in order to be able to vote in a municipal election, you  have to have achieved the age of majority, you have to be a Canadian citizen,  you have to reside in a municipal address within the boundaries of the  municipality for a prescribed period of time, or, if you do not reside within  the municipality but meet the other criteria, and you own real property within  the municipality, as such being a land tax payer, you are entitled to vote in  municipal elections. [10]     It is fair to say, as well, that the CEO of Powell River and the chief  electoral officer have not advanced any evidence to dispute the factual  assertion made by the petitioner that, in fact, four people who were not  eligible to vote in fact did. [11]     I am, as such, satisfied on a balance of probabilities that in the  municipal election in Powell River on the 20th of October 2018 that four people  voted who were not entitled to vote. Of course, how or why those people voted  or who those people are remains an open question, but the reality is that four  people voted who were not entitled. [12]     The  Local Government Act  is the piece of legislation which  governs the affairs of most municipalities in British Columbia. The  Local  Government Act , in Part 3, deals with the provisions for voting and  specifically for setting aside a vote. [13]     The relevant section under the section of \"Declaration of Invalid Election\",  s. 153(5)(b) reads: (5) An application may be made only on one or more of the  following bases: . . . (b) that an election should be declared invalid because it  was not conducted in accordance with this Act or a regulation or bylaw under  this Act; [14]     That is the basis on which Mr. Drummond makes his application and files  his petition before the court. [15]     His basis for saying that the election was not conducted or was not in  accordance with the  Act  is, of course, his assertion, which I accept, on  a balance of probabilities, that four persons who were not eligible to vote in  fact did. [16]     Additionally, the powers of the court on this type of application are  set out in s. 155 of the  Local Government Act . Section 155(2) reads  as follows: (2) On the hearing of an application under section 153  regarding the validity of an election, the court may . . . (c) declare that the election of a candidate is invalid and  that the office is vacant . . . [17]     Additionally, germane to my decision today is s. 155(3) of the  Local  Government Act  which reads as follows: (3) The court must not declare an election invalid by reason  only of an irregularity or failure to comply with this Act or a regulation or  bylaw under this Act if the court is satisfied that (a) the election was conducted in good faith and in  accordance with the principles of this Act, and (b) the irregularity or failure did not materially affect  the result of the election. [18]     I should say here that I am satisfied that everyone involved in the  electoral process in Powell River on the 20th of October, 2018, acted in good  faith. There is no suggestion of a purposeful or wilful intent to contravene  the  Act . It would appear that the poll workers accepted declarations  from these four people that they were eligible to vote, as the poll workers  should have. Unfortunately, these people, the four people in question, likely  thought that they were eligible to vote, but as it turns out they were not, on  the evidence before me. [19]     As an aside, future avoidance of this problem may be solved if poll  workers are instructed to cross check addresses noted on voter registrations  with civic addresses within the municipal boundaries. [20]     Now, having found that the election was conducted in good faith in  accordance with the principles of the  Act , having found essentially that  there was no bad faith, that there was no intentional inappropriate voting, the  issue becomes whether or not the irregularity or failure materially affected  the result of the election. [21]     That issue has been canvassed relatively recently by the Supreme Court  of Canada in the case of  Opitz v. Wrzesnewskyj , 2012 SCC 55. The facts  in that case involved a federal election of, I believe, 2010. There is a  factual dispute between the majority and the minority as to how many irregular  votes there were. The two candidates, Mr. Opitz, the successful candidate, and Mr.  Wrzesnewskyj, the unsuccessful candidate, were separated after final tallies by  26 votes. It was suggested that there were 79 irregular votes cast. The  majority found there only to be 20 irregular votes and upheld the election. The  dissent found there to be 79 irregular votes and would have ordered a new  election. [22]     However, despite this factual determination, my reading of the case is  that both the majority and the minority accepted the following test as an  applicable test as to when the courts should step in and declare an election to  be invalid. Reading a summary from the headnote on page 8 of 79 of that  decision, the Supreme Court of Canada notes the following: Votes cast by persons not  entitled to vote are irregularities that can affect the result of the election,  because they are votes that should not have been cast. If the number of such  votes equals or exceeds the winner\u2019s plurality, then the result of the election  is affected and the election should be annulled. [23]     It goes without saying that judges of the B.C. Supreme Court are bound  by decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada. Though the federal election law  related to federal elections is different than that of the  Local Government  Act , the principles are the same. The principles being that if the  irregularities are such that they would affect the result of an election, it is  appropriate that the election be annulled. [24]     I do not know how these four people who voted, who should not have  voted, cast their votes. There is no way to know that. Mr. Doubt has suggested  to the court that there are many circumstances as to how these people could  have voted, circumstances being of course that they could have voted for both Mr.  Doubt and Mr. Drummond. They could have voted for neither Mr. Drummond nor Mr. Doubt.  They could have voted all for Mr. Drummond, all for Mr. Doubt, in any  combination which adds up to four. But that is not something that is ever  discernible. [25]     All I can say, having accepted the facts that I do accept, is that four  people voted who were not entitled to vote, and the results between Mr. Doubt  and Mr. Drummond is only two votes. [26]     As such, I have to conclude that the irregularity may have affected the  result of the election and it is incumbent upon me, pursuant to the direction  of the Supreme Court of Canada in  Opitz , to declare the election to be  annulled. I make such a declaration. The position of sixth city councillor in  Powell River is, as such and as of today's date, vacant and it is incumbent  upon the City of Powell River to make a determination pursuant to the  Local  Government Act  as to whether or not a municipal by\u2011election need be  held. I do not have information on that. I am sure they are required to do it,  but that is up to them. [27]     All right, thank you. [28]     MR. REIF: I've got some submissions to make on costs. [29]     THE COURT: Go ahead. [SUBMISSIONS RE COSTS FROM 2:18:40 P.M. TO 2:24:09 P.M.] [30]     THE COURT: All right. I have reviewed the bill of costs of Mr. Drummond.  I am satisfied that, in regards to Item Number 1, three units should be allowed.  Item Number 2, five units should be allowed. Item Number 6, three units should  be allowed. The rest are all required units. That means he is entitled to 39  units. That is $4,290; $480.48 in taxes; for a total of $4,770.48, plus $929.05  for disbursements, all of which are reasonable, for a total of $5,699.53. I  will give the City of Powell River 30 days to pay those costs. \u201cGroves  J.\u201d",

Beguin,   2019 BCCA 50 Date: 20190124 Docket: CA45566 Between: Regina Respondent And Devon Skyler Beguin Appellant Before: The Honourable Madam Justice Newbury The Honourable Madam Justice Stromberg-Stein The Honourable Madam Justice Fisher On appeal from: An  order of the Provincial Court of British Columbia, dated   January 24, 2018 ( R. v. Beguin , Vancouver Docket 246189-2-C). Oral Reasons for Judgment The Appellant, appearing in person: D.S. Beguin Counsel for the Respondent: M.A. Mereigh Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 24, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 24, 2019   Summary: Mr. Beguin was  sentenced to three years and three months\u2019 imprisonment followed by two years\u2019  probation for committing three bank robberies. He appeals his sentence on the  basis that the judge erred in failing to appoint amicus to assist him; erred in  principle and imposed an unfit sentence or imposed a demonstrably unfit  sentence; and erred in failing to credit him an additional 71 days for  pre-sentence custody. Held: appeal allowed to the extent of crediting Mr. Beguin  for an additional 71 days pre-sentence custody, which the Crown concedes.  Appointing amicus would have been inappropriate in this case. The sentencing  judge did not err in principle and the sentence was not demonstrably unfit  given the circumstances of the offences and offender. [1]     STROMBERG-STEIN J.A. : Devon Skyler Beguin entered guilty pleas to  three bank robberies, contrary to s. 344 of the  Criminal Code ,  R.S.C. 1985, c. C\u201146, and one \u2018face masking\u2019 offence, contrary to  s. 351(2) of the  Criminal Code . These offences occurred over six  days in mid-December 2016. He was sentenced to an effective sentence of three  years and three months\u2019 imprisonment, plus two years\u2019 probation. He was credited  17 months for pre-sentence custody. He appeals, seeking to reduce the custodial  portion of his sentence to two or three years on the basis that the judge erred  in principle. Today he seeks to eliminate the probationary term. In addition,  he seeks a further credit of 71 days for pre-sentence custody. [2]     The Crown seeks to adduce as fresh evidence an affidavit demonstrating Mr. Beguin  is, in fact, entitled to a further credit of 71 days for pre-sentence custody.  The application to adduce fresh evidence is granted.  [3]     The Crown concedes the sentence should be adjusted by 71 days but that  otherwise the appeal should be dismissed, as the sentencing judge committed no  material errors impacting the sentence and the sentence is not demonstrably  unfit.  [4]     An appellate court is constrained on review of a sentence. This Court  will not interfere with a sentence unless (1) the sentencing judge committed an  error in principle, failed to consider a relevant factor, or erroneously  considered an aggravating or mitigating factor that had an impact on sentence;  or (2) the sentence is demonstrably unfit:  R. v. Lacasse , 2015 SCC 64.  [5]     The first robbery occurred on December 18, 2016, and Mr. Beguin was  unmasked. He gave a note to the teller indicating \u201cthere is a robbery\u201d. The  note was written on a court document Mr. Beguin had received when he had  been released from custody on December 13, 2016, and it contained Mr. Beguin\u2019s  name and photograph. The teller gave him $200. In the second robbery on  December 20, 2016, he was masked, hooded, gloved, and wore plastic bags on his  feet. He demanded $20,000 to $30,000 but left with $500. In the third robbery  on December 23, 2016, he was masked and hooded and armed with a knife and  pepper spray. He told the teller \u201cThis is a robbery\u201d. He received $500.  [6]     He was arrested on December 29, 2016, following reports of erratic  driving and has been in custody since then.  [7]     Mr. Beguin had counsel but chose to represent himself at the  sentencing hearing despite many entreaties from many judges that he should  retain counsel. He sought a sentence of time served or at the low end of the  range suggested by the Crown. The Crown sought a three- to five-year sentence,  which was a low sentence in their estimation given the nature of the offences  and Mr. Beguin\u2019s criminal history. The Crown submitted that in recognition  of Mr. Beguin\u2019s personal history and cognitive disabilities a three-year  sentence would be appropriate.  [8]     Mr. Beguin is 26 years old. He has a grade 10 education. He has a  low IQ. He is unemployed but claims that in the past he worked at a rebar  company. He has a criminal record, commencing as a youth, with 32 prior  convictions including related offences and various breaches of court orders.  The prior convictions are described at para. 18 of the judge\u2019s sentencing  reasons. At the time of these offences, he had just been released for similar  offences for which he had received a three-year sentence and 18 months\u2019  probation.  [9]     The pre-sentence report indicates he lacks insight, has poor problem-solving  skills, has pro-criminal attitudes, and has a history of substance abuse and non-compliance  with court orders. The psychiatric assessment documents a history of mild  mental cognitive impairment and serious substance abuse. He has received a number  of serious psychiatric diagnoses and is considered a high risk to re-offend.  [10]     The sentencing judge noted he had a troubled, abusive, chaotic childhood  and was in foster care. She noted he had been diagnosed with ADHD, fetal  alcohol spectrum disorder, mild mental retardation, antisocial personality  disorder, polysubstance abuse, drug induced psychosis, psychosis not otherwise  specified, schizoaffective disorder, and schizophrenia.  [11]     While in custody, Mr. Beguin has chosen to stay in voluntary  segregation.  [12]     The victims were contacted but did not provide victim impact statements. [13]     The judge noted that the applicable sentencing principles were specific  and general deterrence, denunciation, and protection of the public. She  observed that Mr. Beguin had expressed no interest in rehabilitation when  dealing with the author of the pre-sentence report; however, he told the judge  he was willing to go for counselling in the community and get a job.  Notwithstanding Mr. Beguin\u2019s poor history of compliance with community  supervision, the judge still considered rehabilitation a relevant sentencing  objective. She was live to the fundamental sentencing principle of  proportionality. She weighed the seriousness of the crimes but considered his  moral blameworthiness diminished due to his low intellectual functioning and  other challenges. She recognized he took responsibility for his crimes by  entering guilty pleas, which she weighed heavily as a mitigating factor. She  recognized that the crimes were not sophisticated but noted the level of  violence had escalated as he went from being unmasked, to masked, to masked  with two weapons.  [14]     The judge commented that she needed to impose a fair and fit sentence  that reflected his record. She considered the fact that Mr. Beguin\u2019s last  offences were two robberies for which he had received a three-year sentence and  she was now sentencing him for three robberies. She said that for this reason  alone she had to impose more than a three-year sentence. Therefore, she imposed  a sentence of three years and three months to be followed by two years\u2019  probation. She credited Mr. Beguin with 17 months for pre-sentence custody  as calculated by trial Crown counsel, which meant he had a further 22 months in  custody. [15]     The aggravating features of Mr. Beguin\u2019s offences include the  nature of the offences \u2013 targeting vulnerable bank employees while masked on  two occasions and armed on one occasion; his related criminal record; and the  fact that he committed these offences within days of being released and while  on probation for two robberies where he had received a three-year sentence.  [16]     The mitigating features are that he entered guilty pleas to the offences  and his moral blameworthiness is somewhat diminished due to his low  intellectual functioning and other challenges.  [17]     In the trial court, Mr. Beguin discharged his lawyer prior to  sentencing. He has done the same on appeal. This Court has the benefit of his  discharged former lawyer\u2019s sentencing statement for this appeal to which the  Crown has responded in its sentencing statement. One of his grounds of appeal  is that the sentencing judge should have appointed  amicus  to assist him  in making his submissions. In my view, the sentencing judge committed no error  in refusing to appoint  amicus . It is not appropriate to appoint  amicus   in the circumstances. The role of an  amicus  is to assist the court, not  the accused. Further, Mr. Beguin was appointed counsel but chose in the  trial court (and has chosen on appeal) to represent himself. This ground of  appeal has no merit, in my view. [18]     Mr. Beguin has submitted today that his sentence is too long as  compared to other sentences for other crimes. He has given examples of three cases:  two for manslaughter and one for fraud. I do not consider these cases to be of  much assistance to his case. Although he indicated in oral argument that he was  not relying on his counsel\u2019s sentencing statement, we have considered it in his  interests. In that statement, Mr. Beguin suggests the judge erred in  finding that because he was sentenced to three years\u2019 imprisonment for his  prior offences she had to sentence him to more than three years\u2019 imprisonment  for these offences. He says the three-year sentence was, in fact, for five  offences: two robberies, two masking offences, and one offence for mischief.  [19]     R. v. Brogan , 1999 BCCA 278 sets the appropriate range for  robbery with violence at two to nine years. In my view, the judge properly  increased the sentence by three months more than his last sentence for similar  offences because of the aggravating factor of committing the offences within a  few days of being released from custody and while on probation for the prior  robbery offences. As was recognized by the sentencing judge, the sentence she  imposed was on the low end of what would otherwise be an appropriate sentence given  the nature and circumstances of the offences and offender.  [20]     Mr. Beguin suggests the judge improperly considered that he was  masked on the December 28, 2016 robbery because he did not plead guilty to the  masking count on the Information. However, this was an uncontested circumstance  of the offence, which the Crown properly referred to for identification  purposes as well as in the context of relating the circumstances of the offences.   [21]     In my view, there were no errors in principle in the judge\u2019s approach to  sentencing Mr. Beguin that impacted the sentence. The sentences imposed  were fit in the circumstances. This includes both the custodial portion of the  sentence and the probationary term, which Mr. Beguin now, in oral  argument, claims is too long. Nor can it be said that the sentence was  demonstrably unfit. As has been noted, the sentence is at the low end of what is  appropriate in the circumstances. [22]     As I have indicated, the sentencing judge erred with respect to the  calculation of pre-sentence custody credit as a result of information provided  by trial Crown counsel. Crown counsel on appeal concedes that Mr. Beguin  is entitled to a further 71 days\u2019 credit for pre-sentence custody. Therefore,  the sentence will be reduced by 71 days.  [23]     I would allow the appeal to the extent of crediting Mr. Beguin with  a further 71 days for pre-sentence custody. Otherwise, I would dismiss his  appeal. [24]     NEWBURY J.A. : I agree. [25]     FISHER J.A. : I agree. [26]     NEWBURY J.A. : The appeal is allowed to the extent indicated. \u201cThe Honourable Madam Justice Stromberg-Stein\u201d",

        "text": "COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA Citation: Ahluwalia v. Richmond Taxi Co. Holdings Ltd.,   2021 BCCA 43 Date: 20210201 Docket: CA46504 Between: Ranjit Singh  Ahluwalia Appellant (Plaintiff) And Richmond Taxi Co.  Holdings Ltd. (Duart),    Richmond Taxi Co. Limited (Duart), Richmond Taxi Cabs Ltd.,    Bank of Montreal Respondents (Defendants) Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice Harris (In Chambers) On appeal from: An  order of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, dated    October 18, 2019 ( Ahluwalia v. Richmond Taxi Co. Holdings Ltd. , 2019 BCSC 2189,     New Westminster Docket 201451).  The Appellant, appearing in person with     H. Ahluwalia who translated on his behalf    (via teleconference): R.S. Ahluwalia Counsel for the Respondents     Richmond Taxi Co. Holdings Ltd. and     Richmond Taxi Co. Ltd.    (via teleconference): B.A. Thompson Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 21, 2021 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British   Columbia February 1, 2021     Summary: The respondents apply for an  order dismissing the appeal as abandoned for non\u2011compliance with the filing  deadlines established by the Court of Appeal Rules. The appellant cross applies  for an order extending the time to file appeal materials. Held: Application  granted, cross application dismissed. The chambers judge struck the underlying  claims in this action as being vexatious and barred by the doctrines of res  judicata, cause of action and issue estoppel, and abuse of process. The claims  relate to the same two events that were litigated and finally decided in  actions beginning in 1994. The appeal is devoid of merit and the appellant  did not offer an adequate explanation for the delay in advancing it. The appeal  is dismissed as abandoned.  Reasons for Judgment of the Honourable  Mr. Justice Harris: [1]     The respondents, Richmond Taxi Co. Holdings Ltd. and  Richmond Taxi Co. Ltd., seek an order dismissing the appeal as abandoned. The  appellant, Ranjit Singh Ahluwalia, applies for an extension of time of four  weeks to file an appeal record. [2]     This appeal arises from an order of Justice Marzari in  Chambers dated October 18, 2019 striking out the appellant\u2019s claims  and dismissing his 2018 action against the respondents pursuant to R. 9\u20115(1)(b)  and (d) of the  Supreme Court Civil Rules :  Ahluwalia v. Richmond  Taxi Co. Holdings Ltd. , 2019 BCSC 2189. The chambers judge also  found that Mr. Ahluwalia is not entitled to maintain a certificate of  pending litigation on any property on the basis of his claims in the action.  She further allowed two other applications which are not at issue in this  appeal: one for a vexatious litigant order against the appellant pursuant to  s. 18 of the  Supreme Court Act  and another for increased costs  following the appellant\u2019s discontinuation of a 2016 action. [3]     Mr. Ahluwalia filed a Notice of Appeal on November 12, 2019.  To date, he has not filed or served an appeal record, appeal book or factum.  The deadline for the appeal record was January 13, 2020 and the  deadline for the appeal book and factum was February 12, 2020, in  accordance with the  Court of Appeal Rules . [4]     On March 11, 2020, the respondents offered the appellant the  opportunity to late file his appeal record by consent provided this was done by  April 3, 2020. He replied on May 8, 2020, advising them  that he would pursue the appeal when the courts reopened in light of COVID\u201119  restrictions in place at that time.  [5]     Mr.  Ahluwalia  has taken no steps since the  suspension of the running of time limits ended on September 13, 2020,  save to apply, in an application filed January 12, 2021, for an  extension of time to file the appeal record. On November 4, 2020, the  applicants put Mr.  Ahluwalia  on notice that they  intended to bring this application and sought dates from him. This application  was filed on December 20, 2020.  [6]     Mr.  Ahluwalia  had not complied with the  time limits to file his appeal record, appeal books or factum even before the  time limits applicable for their filing were suspended on March 18, 2020  in light of the COVID\u201119 pandemic. It appears that he filed his motion to  extend time as a reaction to the respondents\u2019 motion to have his appeal  dismissed as abandoned. [7]     The test to determine whether an extension of time should be granted is  the same as the test for whether an appeal should be dismissed as abandoned. It  is set out in  Davies v. C.I.B.C.  (1987), 15 B.C.L.R. (2d) 256  (C.A.): [20] ...First, was there a bona fide intention to  appeal? Second, when were the respondents informed of this intention? Third,  would the respondents be unduly prejudiced by an extension? Fourth, is there  merit in the appeal? And fifth, is it in the interest of justice that an  extension be granted?  ...  [22] The fifth question I  think to be the most important as it encompasses the other four questions and states  the decisive question. \u2026 [8]     In my opinion, the critical question before me is whether it is in the  interests of justice to permit this appeal to continue, or to dismiss it as  abandoned. To address that question, I think it is necessary to focus on the lack  of merit in this appeal. I do not suggest that I will exercise my discretion  solely on the basis that the appeal lacks merit, but its lack of merit in  combination with other factors, to which I will turn, leads me to the view that  the appeal should be dismissed as abandoned. [9]     As I have noted, the order under appeal arose out of an application by  the respondents to have the action dismissed in the British Columbia Supreme  Court. This action is one among a series of actions in which Mr.  Ahluwalia  has litigated and relitigated substantially the  same issues. As noted by the judge in describing the issues in the action  before her: [13] The 2018 action  essentially repeats the claims in the 2016 action:  a) First, Mr. Ahluwalia  claims that one or more of the defendants wrongfully seized Cab No. 9 on  August 1, 1998, and failed to return it, and Mr. Ahluwalia seeks an  accounting of the profits from its use. In addition, he seeks to trace the  profits from the seizure of that cab to the purchase of other property,  possibly another cab, and he claims an equitable interest in that property. To  that end, he has filed a certificate of pending litigation (\u201cCPL\u201d) against that  property; and b) Second, Mr. Ahluwalia  alleges the defendants failed to acknowledge him as the sole shareholder or  principal owner of Richmond Cabs and Coral Cabs since 1988, and he seeks orders  that he is entitled to take possession of all their assets and all the profits  derived from the operation of these companies, together with an accounting of  the assets and profits of these companies since 1988. [10]     The judge then undertook a careful and detailed examination of the  complex procedural history arising out of the circumstances just described. I  do not intend to repeat that history here, but I observe that the substance of  these matters were dealt with in 1994 by Madam Justice Newbury (as she  then was) in a 19\u2011day trial. Her judgment dismissing Mr.  Ahluwalia \u2019s action was upheld on appeal. There have since  been other proceedings raising either the same issues or issues that ought to  have been raised at the outset. Those proceedings have been dismissed. For  example, in 1997 an action was dismissed as being  res judicata   based on the 1994 trial judgment. [11]     After carefully examining both the substance of the allegations in  previous litigation, and the basis on which they were dealt with by the courts,  the judge identified the issue before her: [56] As I said at the outset of Mr. Ahluwalia\u2019s  submissions and his review of his evidence, my concern in these applications is  not to determine whether his current claims should succeed on their merits, but  whether the claims he advances in the 2018 action arise from the same or a  different set of factual events or circumstances, or different parties, than  the claims he has already advanced in this Court since 1994. It is a lower  threshold that he has to meet than proving the merit of the claims themselves,  but he still has to meet it. [57] To this end, I brought  him back again and again to the question of when he became aware of the claims  he is advancing in the 2018 action and how he says the claims he is advancing  in the 2018 action differ from the claims he was previously advancing and was  unsuccessful with respect to. [12]     The judge then made the following finding: [58] Having gone through  this process, I am confident that Mr. Ahluwalia\u2019s claims continue to arise  from the same two significant events that his previous claims arose from: a) First, his purchase of  shares and his entering into a share agreement with Richmond Cabs, together  with an assignment of rights from Mr. Khan, in 1988 that gave him the  right to drive Cab No. 9 with airport privileges; and  b) Second, the seizure of Cab No. 9  from him in August 1998. [13]     She went on to find: [66] Regardless of the  potential merit of these claims, I agree with the Richmond Taxi Defendants that  these claims fundamentally contradict and seek to undermine the findings of  Newbury J. and the Court of Appeal on essential findings made after a 19-day  trial in 1994. Those proceedings conclusively and finally determined the  fundamental nature of the agreement Mr. Ahluwalia and the other drivers  entered into with Richmond Cabs in 1987 and 1988. [14]     In short,  all of the issues the appellant sought to  advance in the 2018 action had already been decided against him, and he  was barred from advancing them in court by the doctrines of cause of action  estoppel, issue estoppel and abuse of process:  Ahluwalia  at paras. 70\u201385.  She further found that the 2018 action was a vexatious proceeding:  Ahluwalia   at para. 86. [15]     In my opinion, the proposed appeal is devoid of merit. Neither  in his materials, nor during submissions, did Mr. Ahluwalia identify any  error in the judge\u2019s understanding or characterization of the issues in  previous proceedings, nor the issues he sought to raise in this action. He  provided no foundation to conclude that the judge misapprehended the facts. He  offered nothing to suggest that the judge either misunderstood the law  applicable to the issues before her, or that she misapplied it. Having reviewed  the record, I can detect no arguable error in respect of any of these matters  that is capable of raising the prospect that a division of this Court would  interfere with the judgment. [16]     Mr. Ahluwalia sought to persuade me that he had  located documents that cast a different light on the issues that had previously  been litigated. He suggested that he had new or fresh evidence that he said he  should be able to advance. If he did so, the impediments provided by the  history of previous litigation would fall away. I had no evidence of these  suggestions, but in any event, I do not think there is any prospect that, after  all of these proceedings over many years, a court would in effect reopen  matters that have finally been determined to allow substantially the same  matters to be litigated again. The judge below was alive to these arguments and  clearly spent considerable time trying to tease out of Mr. Ahluwalia  whether there were facts or issues that would take him outside the scope of the  doctrines she was asked to apply. I see no arguable case that the judge erred  in the way she disposed of this aspect of the matter. [17]     In my view, it is in the interests of justice to  dismiss the appeal as abandoned. Timelines have been missed, even before those timelines  were suspended because of the pandemic. I am satisfied that Mr. Ahluwalia  was aware (given his history of applying for extensions in other proceedings)  of the need to comply with timelines for prosecuting an appeal. Mr. Ahluwalia  has registered a certificate of pending litigation, the continuing presence of  which I accept is a prejudice to the respondents. The judge pronounced a  vexatious litigant order against Mr. Ahluwalia. Although, Mr. Ahluwalia  offered some explanation of the delays in prosecuting the appeal, I am not  persuaded that they satisfactorily explain the full extent of the delay. I am  satisfied that Mr. Ahluwalia could have and should have prosecuted this  appeal with greater respect for his obligations than he has displayed. [18]     In my view, it is time to bring this litigation to an  end. In one form or another it has been ongoing since the early 1990s. The  issues that were there to be litigated properly were finally decided many years  ago. In my judgment, the interests of justice compel that the appeal be  dismissed as abandoned. I so order. \u201cThe Honourable Mr.  Justice Harris\u201d",

Haniak , 2017 BCSC 549, New Westminster Dockets  M122025; M133802; M132800). The Appellants, appearing in person: Y. Ma H. Maung Counsel for the Respondents: J.R. Bradbury Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British   Columbia December 21, 2018 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 18, 2019   Written Reasons by: The Honourable Madam Justice Newbury   Summary: Application for order  removing three appeals from inactive list refused. Reasons for Judgment of the Honourable  Madam Justice Newbury: [1]     The three appeals that are the subject of this application for removal from  the inactive list pursuant to s. 25 of the  Court of Appeal Act ,  R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 77, were brought by the appellants Yin Yin Ma (\u201cMa\u201d) and  her brother Mr. Maung from an order pronounced after trial by Mr. Justice  Armstrong in the Supreme Court of British Columbia on March 31, 2017. The trial  occupied 13 days in early 2016 and concerned three motor vehicle accidents in  which the appellants had been injured and in respect of which they claimed to  have suffered \u201cincapacitating and permanent\u201d injuries. Liability was admitted  in all three cases. For lengthy and detailed reasons indexed as 2017 BCSC 549,  the trial judge made adverse findings of credibility against both plaintiffs  and made awards that were considerably lower than those they had sought. The plaintiffs  were not represented by counsel at trial. [2]     The plaintiffs filed notices of appeal, without the participation of counsel,  on April 13, 2017. The notices state simply that the trial judgment contained  \u201cerrors and mistakes\u201d that negatively affected the outcome of the case. [3]     It is unclear whether the plaintiffs were receiving the advice of legal  counsel in the spring of 2017; but on June 16, 2017, they were in chambers in  person before Madam Justice Garson seeking both an extension of time for the  filing of the appeal record, transcripts and factum, and an order permitting  the number of pages in their factum to be increased to 70. Madam Justice Garson  adjourned the applications for extensions of time and dismissed the application  to increase the length of the factum. In doing so, she expressed some concern  that the plaintiffs were wishing to have the case retried in this court. She  impressed upon them that the standard of review for findings of fact, including  findings of credibility, is that of \u201cpalpable and overriding\u201d error. [4]     Immediately upon receiving Madam Justice Garson\u2019s reasons, the plaintiffs  filed an application for the variation of her order. The parties (the  plaintiffs in person and the defendants represented by Mr. Bradbury)  appeared in chambers before Mr. Justice Harris on June 22, 2017. He  ordered that the time for filing the appeal record and the transcripts of oral  evidence be extended to July 14, 2017; that the time for filing the plaintiffs\u2019  factum be extended to 30 days following the disposition of the application to  vary Madam Justice Garson\u2019s order; and that that application be set for hearing  \u201cno later than October of 2017 on a date convenient to counsel\u201d for the  defendants. [5]     Notwithstanding the latter part of the order, the application to vary  was not heard until December 7, 2017, when the plaintiffs again appeared in  person and Mr. Bradbury appeared on behalf of the defendants before a  division of this court. The Chief Justice gave oral reasons for judgment on the  same date, stating in part:  While the trial judgment is long, and consolidates three  matters, the appellants do not point to more specific reasons as to why the  issues on appeal would be so complex as to take it outside the normal rule. The  fact that the judgment below was lengthy will not mean a lengthy factum is  required on appeal:  Sga\u2019nism  at para. 11. The current limit already  takes into account that appeals may be reasonably complex. Nor did the  appellants provide a draft factum which would help this Court see why an  increase to the page limit should be granted. While such a draft factum is not  required, it is often useful to provide one:  Sga\u2019nism  at para. 5. I  add, the beginnings of a draft factum were handed up by Ms. Ma in oral  submissions to us and we have had a chance to review that while we stood down.  It really does underline the concerns expressed by Justice Garson and confirms  her view of what is, indeed, prompting the requested length of the factum in  this case, and that is the desire to retry every issue of fact that was tried  before Justice Armstrong. I will say more of this after I have completed my  reasons. The chambers judge also properly  conceived the facts on the application. Her reasons indicate she was familiar  with the materials presented and the nature of the underlying appeal. While she  may have described the dispute as arising from a single motor vehicle accident,  a single sentence does not take away from the entirety of her reasons which  demonstrate she was aware of the factual and legal complexities of the appeal.  [At paras. 14-15.] In the result, the plaintiffs\u2019 application was dismissed.  This meant that in accordance with the order of Mr. Justice Harris, the  factum was required to be filed no later than 30 days from December 7, 2017.  That deadline came and went without any such filing. [6]     From affidavit material filed on the present application, it appears  that at some time in March 2018, the plaintiffs retained Mr. P. Cote for  advice, although it is not clear whether that advice was limited to a review of  the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal or also encompassed making all filings and appearances  in the Court on their behalf. (On November 20, 2017, another lawyer who had  carried out some filings for the plaintiffs in November 2017 filed a notice  that he was ceasing to act.)  [7]     On April 17, 2018, the Registrar wrote to the plaintiffs informing them  that their appeals had been placed on the inactive appeal list in accordance  with s. 25(1) of the  Court of Appeal Act . If no steps were taken,  the notices of appeal would stand dismissed as abandoned effective October 12,  2018. [8]     On October 11, 2018, Mr. Cote filed a notice of motion applying for  an order that the plaintiffs\u2019 three appeals be removed from the inactive list.  The hearing of this application was rescheduled from November 15, 2018 to  December 21, 2018 by a \u201crequisition\u201d filed by the plaintiffs personally. The  plaintiffs wrote \u201cby consent\u201d in the requisition form, but as I understand it, Mr. Bradbury  consented only to the rescheduling and not to the granting of the actual  application to be made in chambers.  [9]     Mr. Cote did not appear in chambers and Ms. Ma advised me that  he had ceased acting for the plaintiffs because he was \u201ctoo busy\u201d and that the  plaintiffs would be seeking another lawyer in the new year, 2019. The  plaintiffs handed up to me an affidavit in which they describe their  difficulties dealing with various counsel during the past two years. It is  their view that both Mr. Cote and his predecessor \u201cwasted significant  amount[s] of our time and our extremely limited financial resource[s]\u201d and that  they have faced and continue to face \u201cobstruction of justice since our access  to justice has been blocked since our basic human rights to legal assistance  and legal representation as Canadian citizens in face of serious legal matter  have been repeatedly denied throughout this [these] legal proceedings\u201d in both  courts. [10]     The plaintiffs further claim to have been overwhelmed and \u201ctraumatized\u201d  by the legal proceedings. They contend they did not receive a fair trial and  were \u201cnot allowed\u201d to obtain legal assistance and representation at trial.  Further, they observe that the trial and other hearings had to be rescheduled  due to the death of their father in November 2014 from \u201cso-called cancer\u201d and  the death of their mother in February 2017 due to \u201cso-called pneumonia\u201d. They  depose:  Obviously, we do strongly believe  that these incidents could not be happening coincidentally. It is no doubt that  they are rather conspiracies and coincidences in order to block our access to  justice regarding our three MVAs cases. We do believe that we have been facing  surprise attacks (which absolutely cannot be strange coincidences) by the  deaths of our beloved father and mother each and every time we have to go to  the Court regarding our MVAs cases. [11]     The plaintiffs say they continue to face deliberate obstruction in the  form of the willful destruction of evidence from the trial, the trial  transcripts are missing, and again that they were \u201cnot allowed\u201d to have legal  assistance at trial. They say they will not be able to write an effective factum  or represent themselves on their appeals without such assistance, and request  an extension of seven months in order to retain a lawyer who will prepare and  file a factum and appeal books. I have briefly reviewed Mr. Justice Armstrong\u2019s  reasons and must say that I see nothing on their face to suggest that the  plaintiffs were disadvantaged or mistreated by reason of the fact they were unrepresented.  The judge appears to have carefully considered their arguments and evidence as  he would have if they had been provided by counsel at trial.  [12]     When I questioned Ms. Ma about the grounds of appeal that would be advanced  in their factum, she emphasized the conspiracy she alleges concerning the  coincidence of her parents\u2019 respective deaths and scheduled court dates. Given  her answers to my questions, I believe it is reasonable to infer that neither  the plaintiffs nor any counsel retained by them has identified any possible  error of law or principle in the trial judge\u2019s findings. Nor have they pointed  to any particular error of fact that they wish to challenge. They do not go  beyond the simple assertion in their notice of appeal that the trial judgment  \u201cincludes errors and mistakes.\u201d Analysis [13]     It is well-known that the orders sought by the plaintiffs are  discretionary. The onus is on the applicants to show why the appeals should be  removed from the inactive list and that further time should be granted for the  filing of their factum and appeal record. The onus under s. 25 has been  said to be more onerous than the onus on an applicant for a simple extension of  time: see  Perren v. Lalari , 2009 BCCA 564. It seems to me that in this  case, the relevant factors to be considered include the possible merits of the  appeal, the length of delay that has occurred thus far and any likely future  delays, any prejudice to the defendants, and ultimately and most importantly,  whether the interests of justice support the granting of the order sought. [14]     In my view, they do not. It is now 21 months since the trial judge\u2019s  order was pronounced and despite their efforts, the plaintiffs have been unable  to retain counsel who is willing to assist them in any substantive way. The plaintiffs  themselves acknowledge that they require counsel, but the affidavit material suggests  that they are unable to retain one, for whatever reason. Many people represent  themselves on appeals and do so successfully, but it would be extremely  difficult for the plaintiffs to succeed on their appeals, given the highly  factual nature of the trial judge\u2019s reasons and his findings of credibility. The  plaintiffs have not provided this court with any evidence that would  demonstrate the incorrectness of any of those findings. Indeed, the plaintiffs\u2019  new allegations concerning a connection between the deaths of their parents and  some conspiracy on the part of the defendants indicate to me that the  plaintiffs are desperately seeking grounds of appeal where there are none. Put  another way, the appeals appear to be without merit. [15]     As noted earlier, Madam Justice Garson informed the plaintiffs about the  nature of an appeal and what they must do and what they should have done in  2017 to get their appeal back on track. This did not happen. Although lawyers  have been retained, it appears none has lasted more than a few weeks. It is  unrealistic to believe that the plaintiffs will now be able to find another  lawyer who is ready, willing and able to act in accordance with the plaintiffs\u2019  instructions. The defendants have not shown any particular prejudice that would  result from the orders sought, but the wasting of judicial resources on  meritless appeals is detrimental to the administration of justice. [16]     In all the circumstances, I am not convinced that the interests of justice  support the removal of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeals from the inactive list. I would  therefore dismiss the application. \u201cThe Honourable Madam Justice Newbury\u201d",

        "text": "IN THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA Citation: Century 21 Coastal Realty Ltd. v. 0863846 B.C. Ltd., 2019 BCSC 5 Date: 20190103 Docket: S153796 Registry: New Westminster Between: Century 21 Coastal Realty Ltd. and Vipan Sharma Personal Real Estate Corporation Plaintiffs And 0863846 B.C. Ltd., Prabhdev Singh Khera, Jagdev Singh Khera, Sukhpal Singh Khera and Harvir Singh Sidhu Defendants Before: The Honourable Madam Justice Dardi Reasons for Judgment on Costs Counsel for the Plaintiffs: D. Simon Counsel for the Defendants, Prabhdev Singh Khera, Jagdev Singh Khera and Sukhpal Singh Khera: D. Gautam Place and Date of Hearing : New Westminster, B.C. October 5, 2018 Place and Date of Judgment: New Westminster, B.C. January 3, 2019 [1] On August 24, 2017, I issued reasons for judgment indexed at 2017 BCSC 1498 (the \u201cReasons\u201d). The Court of Appeal decision affirming the Reasons is indexed at 2018 BCCA 298. [2] In the Reasons, I granted liberty to the parties to make submissions on costs. Having heard those submissions, this is my ruling on costs. [3] This dispute arose from a transaction assigning a contract for purchase and sale of certain lands (the \u201cLands\u201d) to the defendant company. The plaintiffs alleged that a related agreement to list the developed Lands for sale with the plaintiffs, (\u201cthe Agreement to List\u201d), was breached when the Lands were subsequently assigned by the defendant company to the three Khera defendants without requiring them to accept the terms of the Agreement to List. The Khera defendants are brothers. [4] The plaintiffs were successful in their claim for inducing breach of contract against the defendant, Prabhdev Khera. The claims against the other two defendants, Jagdev Khera and Sukhpal Khera, were dismissed. [5] The background to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, my findings of fact and the analysis of the legal issues are set out in detail in the Reasons. I need not repeat them here. [6] For convenience and intending no disrespect, I will refer to the Khera defendants by their given names. [7] On the first day of trial, the plaintiffs discontinued their action against 0863846 BC Ltd. and Harvir Sidhu. The trial, originally set for four days, was heard over the course of seven days. [8] Due to scheduling issues, the plaintiffs did not close their case before the defendants made their opening statement. On September 9, 2016, after the defendants made an opening statement and the final plaintiffs\u2019 witness testified, the plaintiffs indicated that they intended to make an application to amend their pleadings to add a cause of action, that of inducing breach of contract. [9] On November 2, 2016, on the first day of the continuation of the trial, I heard the plaintiffs\u2019 application and allowed the amendment to the pleadings. My November 2, 2016 order stipulated that the costs of the amendment application would be borne by the plaintiffs in any event of the cause. [10] The plaintiffs seek an order that the defendants pay the costs of this proceeding at Scale B, less the costs for the one trial day that was awarded to the defendants for the mid-trial amendment application. The plaintiffs submit that the successful defendants, Jagdev and Sukhpal, are not entitled to their costs, but if they are, the unsuccessful defendant, Prabhdev, ought to pay their costs, pursuant to a Sanderson Order: see Rule 14-16(18) of the Supreme Court Civil Rules , B.C. Reg. 168/2009 [the Rules ]. [11] The defendants contend that a Sanderson order is not appropriate and that Jagdev and Sukhpal, as the successful defendants, are entitled to an order for costs against the plaintiffs. [12] The defendants further submit that the plaintiffs are entitled to costs against Prabhdev only for the two days of trial that followed the amendment application. In the alternative, the defendants submit that, since they were successful in defending the claim for piercing the corporate veil, there ought to be apportionment of the costs regarding that issue. The defendants contend that this issue occupied approximately 15% of trial time. [13] As the first step in the analysis, I will address whether the successful defendants are entitled to an order for costs. I will then address the issue of who should pay those costs. [14] Rule 14-1(9), states: Costs to follow event (9) Subject to subrule (12), costs of a proceeding must be awarded to the successful party unless the court otherwise orders. [15] The usual rule is that costs follow the event, so that a substantially successful litigant is entitled to recover costs from the unsuccessful party unless the court orders otherwise : Leung v. Chang , 2014 BCSC 1243 at para. 32. Any discretionary exception to the usual rules regarding costs must be made judicially: Bailey v. Victory (1995), 4 B.C.L.R. (3d) 389 at para. 13 (C.A.). [16] As the plaintiffs were ultimately unsuccessful against Jagdev and Sukhpal, the plaintiffs must persuade the Court that the usual rule should be displaced: Grassi v. WIC Radio Ltd. , 2001 BCCA 376 at para. 24. [17] The plaintiff\u2019s primary contention is that Jagdev and Sukhpal, although not legally liable for any alleged wrongdoing, benefited from Prabhdev\u2019s tortious conduct. The plaintiffs rely on the observation of the Court of Appeal at para 37: \u2026it is readily apparent that Prabhdev\u2019s conduct in causing 086 to breach the Agreement to List was for his own personal benefit and that of his brothers . \u2026 [Emphasis added.] [18] The plaintiffs also underscore that the three Khera brothers jointly owned and developed the Lands. [19] In my view, there is no principled basis for departing from the usual rule. Jagdev and Sukhpal were entirely successful in defending the action. The fact that they benefitted from Prabhdev\u2019s wrongful conduct does not overcome the plain fact that the plaintiffs invoked the Court\u2019s jurisdiction against them unsuccessfully. [20] In the result, I conclude that the successful defendants, Sukhpal and Jagdev, are entitled to their costs of these proceedings. [21] If Jagdev and Sukhpal are entitled to an order for costs, the plaintiffs seek a Sanderson Order, pursuant to Rule 14-1(18), which provides: Costs of one defendant payable by another (18) If the costs of one defendant against a plaintiff ought to be paid by another defendant, the court may order payment to be made by one defendant to the other directly, or may order the plaintiff to pay the costs of the successful defendant and allow the plaintiff to include those costs as a disbursement in the costs payable to the plaintiff by the unsuccessful defendant. [22] A Sanderson Order requires an unsuccessful defendant to pay the costs of a successful defendant. A similar order, a Bullock Order, requires the plaintiff to pay the costs of the successful defendant, but allows the plaintiff to recover these costs against the unsuccessful defendant: Imperial Salmon House Ltd. v. Kzdzalic (1983), 48 B.C.L.R. 256 at 257-258 (S.C.). [23] The essential difference between these two orders is the allocation of risk. A Bullock order requires the plaintiff to bear the risk of non-payment, whereas a Sanderson order allocates the risk of non-payment to the successful defendant: Normak Investments Ltd. v. Belciug , 2015 BCSC 969 at para. 23 [ Normak ]. [24] In Robertson v. North Island College Technical and Vocational Institute (1980), 26 B.C.L.R. 225 at 228, the Court of Appeal articulated the threshold question under Rule 14-1(18) in these terms: There is a threshold question. It is expressed by Vaughan Williams L.J. in Besterman v. British Motor Cab Company Ltd. 919410 3 K.B. 181, a decision of the English Court of Appeal, at page 186, in this way: Under these circumstances, was it a reasonable thing for the plaintiff in his action against a man who ultimately turns out to be in fact the wrong-doer to join the other defendant in order that the matter might be thoroughly threshed out? [25] The subsequent jurisprudence has clarified that such orders are not to be made whenever it was reasonable for the plaintiff to have sued the successful defendant. The authorities mandate that the conduct of the unsuccessful defendant, such as causing the successful defendant to be brought into the litigation, must warrant an order requiring him or her to reimburse the plaintiff for the successful defendant\u2019s costs ( Normak at para. 24). At this second stage of the analytical framework, the court must exercise its discretion judicially. The key question is whether, having regard to the particular circumstances of the case, it would be fair and just to make a Sanderson Order. [26] The plaintiffs submit that it was reasonable for them to have added the two successful defendants as parties to the action as they had no way of knowing who the shareholders of 0863846 BC Ltd., the corporate defendant, were when they commenced the action. The plaintiffs further assert that all three brothers benefitted from Prabhdev\u2019s wrongful conduct, because Jagdev and Sukhpal were on title of the properties that were subsequently subdivided and sold. Further, the plaintiffs point out that, throughout the course of these proceedings, Jagdev and Sukhpal did not raise any objection to being joined as parties; it is only now at the costs hearing that they raise this issue. [27] The defendants\u2019 overarching submission is that it was not reasonable to join Jagdev and Sukhpal as defendants because there was no legal basis for pursuing a claim against them. They contend that a search of the annual reports of 0863846 BC Ltd. would have revealed that neither of Jagdev and Sukhpal were ever directors or shareholders. I note that the annual report would have disclosed the directors but not the shareholders of the company. In any case, in examination for discovery, each of Jagdev and Sukhpal testified that they were never shareholders or directors of 0863846 BC Ltd. [28] In support of their submissions regarding a Sanderson order, the plaintiffs rely on Sohi v. Sohi , 2017 BCSC 720 [ Sohi ]. In an action with multiple defendants who were related family members, the Court in Sohi concluded that a Sanderson order was appropriate. As in this case, all of the respondents in Sohi were represented by the same counsel and did not raise individual defences to the action brought against them. The Court found that the impugned conduct, though insufficient to find liability against one of the defendants, was a \u201cfamily effort\u201d (at para. 85). The Court concluded that the successful defendant\u2019s involvement with the unsuccessful defendant in the material events was sufficient to warrant granting a Sanderson order. [29] It is clear from the circumstances of this case that the plaintiffs believed that Prabhdev was acting in concert with Jagdev and Sukhpal in developing, subdividing and selling the Lands without regard to the Agreement to List. An action for inducing breach of contract is not limited to shareholders or directors of a company who breached the contract. Rather, any individual who may have induced such a breach may be named as a party. Although the evidence fell short of establishing such a claim against Jagdev and Sukhpal, it was reasonable and appropriate for the plaintiffs to have brought a claim against them. [30] Importantly, the preponderance of the evidence supports a finding that Prabhdev, by his tortious conduct intended to, and did benefit his brothers by circumventing the Agreement to List and having a different realtor market the homes on the subdivided Lands. It was Prabhdev\u2019s actions that caused Jagdev and Sukphal to be brought into the litigation. In the circumstances of this case, this is sufficient to warrant granting a Sanderson order. [31] All things considered, I have concluded that it is fair and just to make a Sanderson order. The defendants, Jagdev and Sukhpal, will recover their costs of the action from the unsuccessful defendant, Prabhdev. [32] The burden is on the unsuccessful defendant to persuade the court why it should invoke its discretion to depart from the presumption that costs follow the event. One such exception relates to apportionment. [33] The Rule dealing with apportionment is Rule 14-1(15): Costs of whole or part of proceeding (15) The court may award costs (a) of a proceeding, (b) that relate to some particular application, step or matter in or related to the proceeding, or (c) except so far as they relate to some particular application, step or matter in or related to the proceeding and in awarding those costs the court may fix the amount of costs, including the amount of disbursements. [34] The defendants submit that plaintiff\u2019s attempt to pierce the corporate veil, ought to be treated as a separate and discrete issue. The defendants successfully defended this aspect of the plaintiff\u2019s claim. As I mentioned, the defendants submit that 15% of trial time ought to be allocated to this unsuccessful plea. [35] The plaintiffs counter with the submission that they were substantially successful at trial and should be awarded costs for the whole action. They contend that the evidence pertaining to issue of piercing of the corporate veil was interwoven with and overlapped with the evidence that would have been led by the plaintiffs even if they had not sought to impose personal liability upon the defendants for the defendant corporation\u2019s breach of contract. [36] In Lewis v. Lehigh Northwest Cement Ltd. , 2009 BCCA 424, the Court of Appeal underscored that an order for apportionment of costs is exceptional and should be restricted to rare circumstances (at paras. 36-37). [37] The judicial test for apportionment of costs was formulated by the Court of Appeal in Sutherland v. Canada (Attorney General) , 2008 BCCA 27 at para. 31 [ Sutherland ], which dealt with Rule 57(15), the predecessor to Rule 14-1(15): (1) The party seeking apportionment must establish that there are separate and discrete issues upon which the ultimately unsuccessful party succeeded at trial; (2) there must be a basis on which the trial judge can identify the time attributable to the trial of these separate issues; (3) it must be shown that apportionment would effect a just result. [38] Given the substantially similar wording of the rules, the Sutherland principles are applicable to the court\u2019s discretion under the new Rule 14-1(15): 0915406 BC Ltd. v. 0834618 BC Ltd. , 2013 BCSC 1529 at para. 7. [39] The defendants must establish all three constituent elements of the test to succeed in an apportionment of costs. On the third branch of the test, the Court in Sutherland stated that, if a party has prolonged the proceedings unnecessarily, this favours apportionment for the unnecessary time (at para. 33). A party who has raised an unnecessary issue, raised a spurious defence, or \u201cover litigated\u201d an issue properly raised by the other party may be found to have unnecessarily prolonged the proceedings (at para. 34). If the trial judge concludes that the evidence raised on this issue was irrelevant, this militates in favour of finding it was unnecessary (at para. 35). On the other hand, Mr. Justice Skolrood, in Liu v. Bourget , 2014 BCSC 1534 at para. 20, observed that, if the evidence is interwoven with the evidence going to other elements of the plaintiff\u2019s case, it is not appropriate to divide the issues into discrete components for the purpose of apportioning costs. [40] This is not an exceptional case in which the issues considered by the Court were clearly discrete. In my view, the factual issues would have been substantially the same regardless of whether the plaintiffs had pursued a claim in relation to piercing the corporate veil. The evidence relating to piercing the corporate veil was interwoven with the evidence going to other elements of the plaintiffs\u2019 case. It is not possible to divide the issues into discrete components for the purposes of apportioning costs. Even if I were able to identify the time attributable to the issue of piercing the corporate veil, I am not persuaded that dividing the issues into discrete components for purposes of an apportionment of costs would effect a just result. [41] Finally, I address the defendants\u2019 submission that the plaintiff is not entitled to costs for the first three days of trial as the evidence did not relate to the claim for inducing breach of contract and were costs thrown away. I am not persuaded that there is merit to this submission. [42] The evidence led by the plaintiffs prior to the amendment application was relevant to proving the plaintiffs\u2019 claim generally. The evidence on the formation of the contract served as the underpinning of my findings regarding the enforceability of the contract. This was a constituent element of proving the tort of inducing breach of contract. Moreover, the evidence pertaining to the interactions between the parties, the breach of the contract and Prabhdev\u2019s conduct was also pertinent to proving the claim of inducing a breach of contract. [43] In short, I find that the plaintiffs were substantially successful in the action against Prabhdev and are therefore entitled to a costs award against him. [44] In the result, I order that the plaintiffs are entitled to their costs of the proceeding against Prabhdev, the unsuccessful defendant pursuant to Rule 14-1(9). Pursuant to my ruling on November 2, 2016, the defendants are entitled to costs against the plaintiff for one day of trial that related to the amendment application. Those costs will be set off from the costs for six days of trial that the plaintiffs are otherwise entitled to recover from Prabhdev. The net result is that the plaintiff is entitled to costs of the proceeding against Prabhdev, inclusive of five (and not seven) days of trial. [45] As this case was one of ordinary difficulty costs will be awarded at Scale B. [46] I order that the successful defendants, Jagdev and Sukhpal, are entitled to their costs of the action at Scale B. Pursuant to Rule 14-1(18), they must recover their costs against the unsuccessful defendant, Prabhdev. [47] The plaintiffs are entitled to the costs of this costs application. \u201cDardi J.\u201d",

        "text": "IN THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA Citation: 1164803 BC Ltd. v. ACME Visa Solutions Limited, 2022 BCSC 273 Date: 20220114 Docket: NEW-S-S-242089 Registry: New Westminster Between: 1164803 B.C. LTD. Plaintiff And ACME Visa Solutions Limited Defendant Before: The Honourable Justice Branch Oral Reasons for Judgment In Chambers Counsel for the Plaintiff: S. Alimirzaee Counsel for the Defendant: D. Chodha F. Grewal Place and Date of Trial/Hearing: New Westminster, B.C. January 12, 2022 Place and Date of Judgment: New Westminster, B.C. January 14, 2022 [1] THE COURT: This is an application by the plaintiff landlord seeking a writ of possession requiring that the defendant tenant quit the premises defined in paragraph 2 of the factual basis of the plaintiff's application (\u201cPremises\u201d) by at least January 28, 2022. [2] The defendant consented to the show cause hearing and the merits hearing occurring together, and did not dispute that the preliminary show cause test was met. Rather their submissions were devoted to the merits themselves. [3] Turning then to those merits, the plaintiff says that it provided notice of termination of the December 6, 2019 lease in place with the defendant (\u201cLease\u201d) by at least December 28, 2021. The Lease term ended on October 15, 2021, but the Lease provides that If the Tenant shall continue to occupy the Lease Premises at the expiration of the term of this lease or any renewal period thereof with or without the consent of the landlord and without any further written agreement, the Tenant shall be a monthly Tenant at the rent herein mentioned and on the terms and conditions set out except as to the length of the tenancy. [4] As such, the defendant was on a month\u2011to\u2011month Lease at the time of the purported termination, subject to the arguments below. The termination clause in the Lease provides as follows: The Tenant covenants and agrees that on the Landlord\u2019s becoming entitled to re-enter the Leased Premises under any of the provisions of this lease, the Landlord, in addition to all other rights, shall have the right to terminate forthwith this lease and leaving upon the Leased Premises notice of writing of its intention to do so\u2026 [5] To the extent that there may have been procedural flaws in any earlier notices, the plaintiff says that the letter sent by plaintiff's counsel to the defendant on December 28, 2021 (the \u201cNotice\") was most assuredly adequate to satisfy the Notice requirements in the Lease. [6] The first issue that must be addressed is whether this Notice was adequate to terminate the Lease. The defendant does not dispute that it was appropriately delivered. However, the defendant says the Notice purported to be on the basis of certain alleged breaches of the Lease and that such breaches have not been established. Absent proof of the breaches, the defendant says that the Notice is ineffective. [7] The portion of the Notice relied upon by the defendant states: In the event that the court finds an issue with our previous notice of termination we hereby confirm termination of the Lease by reason of the foregoing issues and make demand for immediate possession and return of all keys and other security cards or devices and expressly reserve any and all rights and remedies available to the Landlord pursuant to the terms of Lease relevant statute to common law. [8] I note, however, that this paragraph is the second\u2011to\u2011last paragraph of a two\u2011page letter. The letter begins as follows: Further to our letters dated December 7, 2021, and emails advising 1164803 BC Ltd. (the \u201cLandlord\u201d) that the Lease dated December 6, 2019 (the \u201cLease\u201d) relating to the premises located at Unit 213\u201112564 88 Avenue, Surrey, British Columbia, (the \u201cPremises\u201d) termination on October 15, 2021, and the Landlord requires immediate possession. [9] For the purposes of this application, the plaintiff does not seek to rely on the establishment of any alleged breaches. Rather the plaintiff argues that so long as notice of termination was provided in a timely fashion, there is no need for any breach to be established. The defendant agrees that if the plaintiff had simply relied on the effluxion of time the Notice would be valid, subject to the other arguments addressed below. However, the defendant suggests that the plaintiff is bound by their stated basis for termination, which was the (unestablished) breaches. [10] I do not agree. The plaintiff did not need a reason to terminate the Lease: Mandaville Court v. Muise , 2008 NSSM 11 at paras. 35-39. So long as the letter serves as notice of termination, it should be treated as valid. The references to potential breaches by the plaintiff were simply redundant. Their inclusion does not invalidate the Notice completely. The Notice, when read as a whole, is certainly sufficient to advise the defendant that the plaintiff no longer wanted the Lease to continue. [11] The next issue is whether or not the plaintiff was in a position to terminate. On this point the defendant argues that the plaintiff was not in such a position because the defendant had already exercised its option to renew the Lease for a further two years as of March 15, 2021. [12] The Lease did provide for the potential for the tenant to exercise such a right. However, the difficulty for the defendant is that its notice of renewal was not delivered in a manner provided for in the Lease. The first point to note is that the plaintiff denies ever having received the March 15, 2021 communication from the defendant. The defendant offers no evidence that this denial is untrue. The plaintiff's own subsequent conduct is consistent with not having received the communication. Specifically, on March 30, 2021, the plaintiff delivered a text message to the defendant inquiring about its interest in a renewal, without any mention of any earlier communication from the defendant. Given the available evidence, I accept that the plaintiff did not receive the defendant's March 15, 2021 communication. [13] As noted, the plaintiff did not deliver the communication in a manner set out in the Lease. The Lease provides that \"all notices\u2026which may or are required to be given pursuant to this lease shall be in writing and shall be sufficiently given if delivered, or during times the post office is operating normally, mailed prepaid and registered.\" There is no dispute that the communication was not delivered by registered mail. [14] The defendant suggests that the use of the word \"sufficiently\" in the Notice clause means that there could be other means of providing notice. I disagree. The words preceding \"sufficiently\" are \"shall be\", implying that the condition is mandatory. Secondly, the word \"sufficiently\" does not necessarily imply that there are other ways in which notice may be given. Rather, the proper interpretation, particularly in the face of the use of the words \"shall be\", suggests that only mail delivered in that form shall be \u201csufficient\u201d. I also note that there is a specific clause that opens the door to the parties agreeing to other forms of notice, but the defendant does not argue that this provision is triggered here. [15] The benefit and need for registered mail are reflected in this very case. If the defendant's communication had been registered, then there would have been no debate about whether or not there was a delivery. The defendant would have had virtually overwhelming proof of delivery through the provision of the registration documentation provided with registered mail. [16] The defendant argues in the alternative that the court should grant relief from forfeiture, or alternatively, apply broader equitable principles in order to deem its notice effective, relying on SCP 173 Dining Limited v. Costa del Sol Holdings, 2021 BCSC 1252 at paras. 81-83; 112-114. I decline to adopt either alternative. [17] To the extent that both routes call for the court to consider the equities of the situation, I find that the equities weigh in favour of the plaintiff. a) There is no evidence that the plaintiff breached any term of the Lease. b) There is evidence that the plaintiff changed its position in reliance on the lack of response to their inquiry of the defendant about possible renewal. Specifically, the plaintiff made successful efforts to negotiate the sale of the property to a buyer who expects clear title without any tenancies. Furthermore, the plaintiff provided that there were no ongoing tenancies in its property disclosure statement. Invoking the principles of equity to maintain the defendant's tenancy would potentially put the plaintiff in breach of their contractual or tort obligations to the proposed purchaser. This is not the type of difficulty that can be remedied by the defendant simply bringing its lease payments up\u2011to\u2011date, for example. c) The innocent third-party purchaser would also be potentially damaged by the court invoking equitable principles, given that it would only be able to assume possession of the property if tied to the array of obligations owed to a commercial tenant such as the defendant. d) Turning to the position of the defendant, they are, at least in part, the author of their own misfortune. Specifically, after receiving the text communication from the plaintiff, it should have been abundantly obvious that the plaintiff had not received the earlier communication from the defendant. It would have been a simple thing for the defendant to say to the plaintiff, \u201cdid you not receive our communication on March 15?\u201d, in which case all of these litigation complications would almost certainly have been avoided. e) The defendant suggests that the plaintiff does not come to court with clean hands as a result of the fact that they made allegations of breach that were not justified, and which were never made known during the tenancy. Given my finding above, the issue of the alleged breach is somewhat of a red herring in that the plaintiff does not rely upon them, and I have concluded that the plaintiff did not need to rely upon the breaches in order to justify a termination. Furthermore, in terms of the timing of raising any breaches, the Lease contains a non-waiver clause stating: No condoning, excusing or overlooking by the Landlord of any default, breach or non-observance by the Tenant at any time or times with respect to any covenant, proviso or condition herein contained shall operate as a waiver of the Landlord's right herein with respect to any continuing or subsequent default, breach or non-observance or so as to defeat or affect in any way the rights of the Landlord herein with respect to any such continuing or subsequent default or breach and no waiver shall be inferred from or implied by anything done or omitted by the Landlord, salve only an express waiver in writing. [18] Given all of these factors, I cannot find that there is sufficiently compelling basis to grant relief from forfeiture even assuming it is available: Sechelt Golf and Country Club v Sechelt (District), 2012 BCSC 1105 at para. 128. Nor do I find a basis to evoke any broader equitable principles in order to cure the defendant's failure to provide notice of the exercise of their option for renewal in the proper manner. I conclude that the assertion of the plaintiff's strict legal rights is not unjust or unfair on the facts of this case. [19] Finally, the defendant sought to argue that the plaintiff had breached its contractual duty of good faith. However, even assuming that the court can rely on good faith principles to overcome express contractual provisions, which is doubtful, I do not see any breach of good faith. Insisting on the fulfillment of the black letter notice terms in the Lease is not bad faith. Raising breaches that may not be made out is not necessarily bad faith either. There is no evidence of dishonesty, lying or knowing misleading on the part of the plaintiff. There was no issue regarding the exercise of contractual discretionary powers. The Notice term has no discretionary element. [20] Finally, I see no evidence of unreasonable contractual performance. As the Supreme Court of Canada stated in Wastech Services Ltd. v. Greater Vancouver Sewerage and Drainage District , 2021 SCC 7: [52]\u2026 Importantly, whatever variation may come with context, a contracting party \u2014 unlike a fiduciary \u2014 typically is not required to serve the contractual interests of the other party by duties of good faith performance\u2026. [\u2026] [73] \u2026 The common law recognizes that \u201c[c]ompetition between businesses regularly involves each business taking steps to promote itself at the expense of the other. . . . Far from prohibiting such conduct, the common law seeks to encourage and protect it\u201d (A.I. Enterprises Ltd. v. Bram Enterprises Ltd., 2014 SCC 12, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 177, at para. 31, citing OBG Ltd. v. Allan, [2007] UKHL 21, [2008] 1 A.C. 1, at para. 142). As a general matter, good faith should not be used as a pretext for scrutinizing motive (Bhasin, at para. 70). [74] Not only does this deferential approach ensure \u201csome elbow-room\u201d for the \u201caggressive pursuit of self-interest\u201d (C. Sappideen and P. Vines, eds., Fleming\u2019s The Law of Torts (10th ed. 2011), at para. 30.120; see also A.I. Enterprises, at para. 31), but it also prevents good faith from veering into \u201ca form of ad hoc judicial moralism or \u2018palm tree\u2019 justice\u201d (Bhasin, at para. 70). In this context, then, courts must only ensure parties have not exercised their discretion in ways unconnected to the purposes for which the contract grants that power\u2026 [\u2026] [76] With this approach in mind, I stress that what a court considers unreasonable is highly context-specific, and ultimately \u201cdepend[s] upon the intention of the parties as disclosed by their contract\u201d (Greenberg, at p. 762; see also Sherry v. CIBC Mortgages Inc., 2016 BCCA 240, 88 B.C.L.R. (5th) 105, at paras. 63 \u2011 65; G. R. Hall, Canadian Contractual Interpretation Law (3rd ed. 2016), at pp. 312 \u2011 13). Demonstrating a breach will necessarily centre on an exercise of contractual interpretation. It is in properly interpreting the contract and the purposes for which discretion was granted that the range of good faith behaviour comes into focus and breaches can be identified\u2026 [\u2026] [101] Importantly, the duty did not require Metro to subordinate its interests to those of Wastech in exercising its discretionary power in the manner that Wastech claims. The Contract purposely included no guarantee that the Target OR would be achieved. The parties were aware of the risk that the exercise of discretion represented and chose, notwithstanding long negotiations and a detailed agreement, not to constrain the discretion in the way Wastech now requests. In point of fact, Wastech is asking for an advantage for which it did not bargain. It asks, in effect, that Metro confer a benefit upon it that was not contemplated, expressly or impliedly, under the Contract. On my understanding, this stands outside of the \u201crequirement of justice\u201d identified by Cromwell J. in Bhasin (para. 64)\u2026 [\u2026] [113] I note once again that the duty to exercise discretionary powers in good faith does not require a party to confer a benefit on the other party that was not a part of their original agreement, nor does it require a party to subordinate its interests to those of the other party. [21] As such, for all of the reasons expressed above, I find that the landlord is entitled to a writ of possession effective January 28, 2022.

Sun , Vancouver Dockets S1611338 and S1611176) Counsel for the Appellant: D.K. Fitzpatrick Counsel for the Respondent: J.D. Shields Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British   Columbia December 21, 2018 Place and Date of Judgment with Written Reasons to Follow: Vancouver, British   Columbia December 21, 2018 Place and Date of Written Reasons: Vancouver, British   Columbia January 25, 2019     Summary: Dismissal of application for  stay of an order of incarceration on a finding of contempt. Reasons for Judgment of the Honourable  Madam Justice Newbury: [1]     On December 21, 2018, Mr. Sun\u2019s application for a stay of an  incarceration order following a finding of contempt was before me in chambers.  I dismissed the application with reasons to follow. [2]     Mr. Sun was found personally liable, and liable as the principal of  Besco International Investment Co. Ltd. Judgments were granted in the Supreme  Court against them in July and September 2018 respectively, in the total  principal amount of $1,476,823.78 plus (special) costs and interest. As of  November 13, 2018, the total amount owing was $1,652,632.36.  [3]     Thereafter, Mr. Sun failed to attend an examination in aid of  execution, avoided service of appointments for examinations in aid, failed to  produce documents he had agreed to produce, and failed to provide satisfactory  answers to questions on examination. A registrar certified on November 8 and 9,  2018 that Mr. Sun had failed to pay the judgments without reasonable  excuse and had failed to provide satisfactory answers to questions about his  ability to do so. [4]     The matter then came before Madam Justice Matthews on November 22, 2018.  She ordered  inter alia  that Mr. Sun be incarcerated for six days  and then have 30 days to pay. If payment was not made by December 27, he was to  be incarcerated for a further 30 days. The judge stated in her reasons: There is evidence that Mr. Sun and Besco have  considerable means to satisfy the judgments. Funds well in excess of the  judgment have gone through the Besco bank accounts. Mr. Sun admitted at  his examination in aid of execution that he is capable of borrowing the funds  to satisfy the judgment. He identified funds in corporate bank accounts which  he has access to which could have been paid in partial satisfaction of the  judgment. He agreed to pay those funds in partial satisfaction of the judgment,  but has not done so. There is evidence that he has wilfully taken steps to avoid  being able to pay the judgment, including that he gave three vehicles, one  Bentley and two Range Rovers, to friends. He owns a home on the west side of  Vancouver worth five million dollars. It is encumbered by eight million dollars  in debt to friends. The law pertaining to committal of a party for failing to  comply with a court order was summarized by Mr. Justice Macintosh in  Fitzgerald  Living Trust v. Mountainstar Gold Inc. , 2018 BCSC 1451, based on the  decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in  Carey v. Laiken , 2015 SCC 17.  The first element that must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt is that the  order alleged to have been breached must state clearly and unequivocally what  should and should not be done. The second element is that the party alleged to  have breached the order must have actual acknowledge of it. Finally, the party  allegedly in breach must have intentionally done the act that the order  prohibits or intentionally failed to do the act that the order prohibits. I conclude that each of these  tests [has] been met in this case and the evidence before me is satisfactory to  meet those tests beyond a reasonable doubt. [At paras. 7-10.] Matthews J. was satisfied Mr. Sun had intentionally  avoided paying the judgments or failed to pay them although he had argued at an  examination that he could borrow the money to do so, and the evidence showed he  had \u201caccess to assets in excess of the judgment amount and has disposed of some  of his assets to avoid paying the judgment.\u201d (At para. 13.) [5]     In his argument on behalf of Mr. Sun in this court on December 21,  2018, Mr. Kirkpatrick said all that could be said in favour of his client.  He painted Mr. Sun as a person who has many assets but whose ability to  pay is impaired at the present time. He asked for 90 days in which his client  should, he suggested, be able to borrow the money to pay the judgments. At  times he seemed to suggest the money could definitely be found; at other times  he said his client was willing to pay \u201cbut cannot\u201d. He described Mr. Sun as  a \u201cpoor manager\u201d whose finances are intertwined with those of his family, which  makes it difficult for him to extricate the required amount. [6]     Mr. Shields, on behalf of the creditor, referred on the other hand  to evidence that suggested Mr. Sun has been preferring other creditors  over San Bao and that substantial funds over which Mr. Sun has control  have simply \u201cdisappeared\u201d without explanation. As far as the debt owing to San  Bao is concerned, no real attempts have been made to pay anything; documents  including financial statements and income tax returns of Besco have not been produced  despite being promised; and there is no indication Mr. Sun has made any  effort to persuade his family to help pay his debts. Most tellingly, his  answers to questions regarding his various companies were highly unsatisfactory  and difficult to credit, given the large amounts of money he had previously  claimed to control. All of this conduct is remarkably similar to the conduct  described by Mr. Justice Steeves in his reasons for the original judgment  that confirmed the indebtedness of Mr. Sun and his company: see 2018 BCSC  1128.  [7]     The criteria for the granting of a stay are well known \u2013 whether the  applicant has raised an arguable case on appeal; the question of irreparable  harm if a stay should not or should be granted; the balance of convenience; and  most importantly, the interests of justice. On a consideration of these  factors, I am simply unconvinced that interests of justice are such that a stay  should be granted. As I have already observed, Mr. Sun has repeatedly  neglected to obey court orders, to appear at examinations in aid, to provide  documents he has been ordered to provide, and has failed utterly in providing  relevant information to the creditor concerning his financial position and that  of Besco. [8]     For all the foregoing reasons, the application was dismissed. \u201cThe  Honourable Madam Justice Newbury\u201d",

M. Rosenberg, Q.C.    J. T. Riddell Counsel for Defendant    Attorney General of Canada:    J. A. Rosenthal Counsel for Defendant    City of Richmond: B. B. Olthuis    T.

January 13, 2020  Place and Date of Judgment: Victoria, B.C. January   13, 2020 [1]     THE COURT:  On July 29, 2019, I released a ruling on the  plaintiffs' motion to rely on sworn statements. That was reported at 2019 BCSC  1243. In that ruling I accepted that there were two parts to the necessity  test. The first is whether the witness is unable to attend trial. Obviously  Wesley Modeste is not. I found that the evidence to support the cognitive  decline of Mabel Mitchell was lacking and that the plaintiffs did not establish  the first part of the necessity test with respect to her. I granted leave to the  plaintiffs to adduce better medical evidence to establish her inability to  attend trial. [2]     After the first part of the necessity test has been met, the court is to  assess threshold reliability of the evidence. I heard submissions on the  threshold reliability at the application in July 2019, and I accepted that Wes  Modeste's affidavit had met the threshold reliability test for the following  reasons, which were set out in my reasons, but perhaps not clearly enough.   Firstly, it is a sworn statement. Secondly, it sets out his personal memory.   Thirdly, it sets out oral history which will be subject to the global oral  history objection along with all the other oral history evidence. Fourthly,  Mr. Modeste's father was a Chief and was a family orator who presided over  ceremonies, so was a man of influence in his community. Fifthly, Mr. Modeste  himself was an elected councillor and Chief and therefore, also a respected  member of the community. [3]     For these reasons, I find that the threshold test for reliability and  the first part of the necessity test has been met for the Modeste statement. [4]     I have not made an assessment on the threshold reliability of Mabel  Mitchell's statutory declaration, although I did make some comments about it.   Those comments should be considered  obiter  and not a ruling on the  threshold reliability. [5]     The second part of the necessity test is whether the admission of the  written statement is necessary to prove a relevant fact in this case. [6]     I found that I cannot rule on that until I know what the other  plaintiffs' witnesses say, and this will require submissions from counsel after  the plaintiffs' evidence is in. I do not see the need to file a further notice  of application, but it would be helpful to have counsel circulate outlines of  their arguments in advance so everyone is prepared to argue about the necessity  of the statement at the end of the plaintiffs' case. [7]     If the second part of the necessity test is met, I will then need to  assess the ultimate reliability at the end of trial. [8]     The next question is about the timing of when the written statement of  Wesley Modeste should be read in. It was my intention to have Mr. Modeste's affidavit  read in prior to the oral history objection so that it could be dealt with in  that ruling. The exercise of reading the statement does not mean that the  ultimate necessity and reliability has been accepted because the objections are  still pending, much like they were with the other oral history evidence. [9]     The word \u201cadmissibility\u201d, I think, has created some confusion. For  example, in para. 92 of the ruling when I said acceptance of \u201c... admissibility  is not particularly high. A finding of admissibility does not imply acceptance  of the evidence by the trier of fact\u201d, it would have been more clear if  reworded to say \u201cacceptance of threshold reliability does not imply acceptance  of the evidence by the trier of fact.\u201d [10]     On December 16, 2019, at the case management conference, there was some  discussion about reading in the affidavit while we are sitting in Duncan so  that Mr. Modeste's family could be in attendance. On that day after hearing  the proposed schedule, I thought there would be insufficient time to conclude  all the  viva voce  testimony and that the Modeste statement would have to  be read in in Victoria but that we could accommodate the family with a video  connection. I will not make a firm direction on scheduling until our next  judicial management conference, which is on Wednesday. It appears with the new  time estimates I received on Friday that we may have enough time to complete  the three  viva voce  witnesses within the two weeks, in which case there  would not be time to read in the Modeste statement in any event, but I will  hear more about that on Wednesday. [11]     So just in conclusion, there are five steps to admitting the written  statement. Firstly, the threshold necessity, which has been met for Mr. Modeste,  but not for Mrs. Mitchell. Secondly, threshold reliability, which has  been met for Mr. Modeste, but not for Mrs. Mitchell. Thirdly, once steps 1 and  2 are met, the statement should be read into the record subject to further  objections to oral history evidence contained therein and ultimate necessity of  the statement and the timing of that to be determined. [12]     Fourthly, at the end of the plaintiffs' case all parties will make  submissions on whether the statement was necessary to prove a material fact in  the plaintiffs' case. [13]     And then finally, fifthly, at the end of the trial, in closing, all  parties will make submissions about the ultimate reliability of the sworn  statement. [14]     Mabel Mitchell's statement has not met any of the above tests, so a  continuation of the application must be scheduled by requisition to assess the  new affidavit and medical evidence to see if the threshold necessity and  threshold reliability tests are met. Counsel should exchange brief outlines of  their argument in advance of the hearing of that continuation of the  application.  \u201cB.  M. Young, J.\u201d  The  Honourable Madam Justice Young",

Respondent Before:  The Honourable Mr. Justice G.C. Weatherill Oral Reasons for Judgment In  Chambers Counsel for the Claimant, appearing by teleconference: C. Alvarez Gomez Counsel for the Respondent, appearing by teleconference: J. Stein Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, B.C. January 11, 2021 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, B.C. January 11, 2021   [1]     THE COURT:  The claimant mother applies for orders requiring and  facilitating the return to BC of one of the two children of the parties\u2019  marriage, who I will refer to as \u201cM.\u201d. The claimant says that on January  4, 2021, M. was wrongfully removed from BC by the respondent father and taken  to his home in Los Angeles. [2]     The parties and their two children are Canadian citizens. The parties  began cohabiting in a marriage\u2011like relationship in January 2000. They  were married on November 26, 2004. They have two children, M., who is  currently nine years old; and C., who is currently 13 years old.  [3]     In October 2013, when M. was two years of age, the parties moved with  the children from BC to Los Angeles where they have been living and  working ever since. The parties purchased a home in Studio City, California,  and received their green cards in April 2019. Studio City is a suburb of  Los Angeles. The children have been attending and continue to attend  school there, albeit remotely. [4]     On June 16, 2020, the claimant drove with the children from  Los Angeles to BC to visit family and friends. She intended to return to  Los Angeles in approximately six weeks, in time for the children to return  to school on August 17, 2020.  [5]     In late August 2020, the claimant determined that it would be best if  she extended her stay in BC to September 7, 2020 because of the COVID  pandemic and the extreme forest fires that were taking place along the west  coast of California.  [6]     On September 22, 2020, the claimant sent the following email to the  respondent: Hi Jason.  So I am thinking it would be best  to stay here in Canada a bit longer \u2013 maybe another month. In terms of Covid and  the California fires, it is much safer for the kids to be here and I do not  feel comfortable travelling back at this time. They are doing fine with their  online school, and having extended family here, being able to go to parks, and  do things is good for their well being. We are also still waiting for their  new passports, which will hopefully arrive this month. [7]     The respondent responded approximately one-and-a-half hours later as  follows: As we agreed in our last conversations you stay until  September 7 to stay in Canada not any longer. I will not allow them to  stay any longer in Canada so this is not for you to decide soely [ sic ].  You have had almost 3 weeks since we\u2019ve last talked to get  the passports in order so. As reviewed in our last email, you said they would  be coming home the long weekend and you\u2019ll be back by around the seventh, please  let me know what date you were going to be arriving.  Covid is not an issue in studio city.   There are no forest fires in southern California los Angeles district so  you do not need to worry about any of the hysteria you were seeing on  television. It does not affect our way of living. [8]     On September 10, 2020, the claimant responded: Just following up on our last  email. In doing what is best for the kids, we will be staying in BC longer. [9]     The respondent responded: Can you give me a timeline please? [10]     September 15, 2020, the claimant wrote again: Just following up on our conversation from last week ...  Honestly, I do think it would be  best for the kids and I to stay here more long term, and I would like us to  stay here for the foreseeable future. Obviously the two of us should keep  discussing the long\u2011term plan as the situation develops, but truthfully  I think it is better for the kids and I to just stay here. I understand  with COVID that it would be difficult to see them at this time. Hopefully,  that will change soon. Either way, I encourage you and the kids to have more  communication in the interim. [11]     On September 19, 2020, the claimant wrote to the respondent again: This email is to clarify our  family situation going forward. I\u2019d like to re-affirm that it is clearly  unsafe to travel back to Los Angeles at this time. The fact is we will be  returning when it is safe to drive without fear of smoke, fires, lack of  accommodation en route (due to fires), plus Covid. I trust that we can be  reasonable about this for the sake of our children\u2019s well being. I do still  believe it would be best for us to remain in Canada for the foreseeable future,  however, I understand that I cannot remain here without your consent.   Therefore, it is my intention to return to Los Angeles when it is safe. I  would appreciate if you could recognize our unique situation in an  unprecedented time. It\u2019s not about keeping the kids from you. It\u2019s about the  kids and keeping them safe, happy and healthy. I believe you also desire the  safety of our children. Do you agree that I should stay here in Canada at  least for the time being? If you don\u2019t believe the safety of our children is  paramount and do not provide me consent to stay in Canada, I will prepare for  the return trip to the United States immediately. [12]     The respondent\u2019s responding email is dated September 24, 2020. It is  lengthy and describes the love he feels for the claimant and the children,  difficulties the parties have had over the years and the hurt they have  experienced in their relationship. He went on to write: I will no longer ask you and the  children to come back home to California. This makes no sense and is totally  unproductive to dealing with our issues moving forward, together or not. I  need you to understand I have been advised that if I don\u2019t take legal action  immediately, I lose my ability to secure shared custody of the children. After  my discussion with [C], I have decided it would not be good to proceed with  this action and feel it will further tear the family apart. so I\u2019m going to  trust you and leave it in your hands to be fair when it comes to the children  if we proceed with separation. I\u2019m not relinquishing custody of the children  as they are my life (as are you) but I don\u2019t want to traumatize the children  any further. [C] is too vulnerable right now and is being affected because of  our actions in our relationship, and [M] is too close to you, and I wouldn\u2019t  want to separate her from her mother\u2026I wouldn\u2019t want it any differently. If  you want to relocate and stay in Canada, I will not try and stop you. I want  you and the children to be happy. [13]     I should say in passing that my reference to C. is to the other older  daughter. [14]     The respondent later wrote that: Things will be amicable between  us, and we will work it out. [15]     He wrote again on October 1, 2020, while in BC visiting the children: If you are planning to stay in  Canada, please confirm it is your intent to reside here long term. If so,  please confirm your acknowledgment you will be giving up your US residence and  green card. ... The respondent went on to discuss parenting time with  and parenting responsibility of the children going forward.  [16]     The claimant secured rental accommodation for her and the children in  Surrey, BC. As already stated, the children continued to attend their  California school remotely.  [17]     The respondent travelled to BC and had parenting time with the children  in October and during the period of November 22, 2020 to January 4, 2021.   Parenting time was informal and was roughly on a week\u2011on/week\u2011off  basis during that period. [18]     The respondent commenced divorce proceedings in California on  November 19, 2020. The claimant was served with those proceedings on December  11, 2020 and has since attorned to the jurisdiction of the California courts.  [19]     The respondent took the children to Whistler between Christmas and New  Year\u2019s Day. He planned to return to California alone on January 1, 2021. When  he dropped the children off at the claimant\u2019s home that day, M. informed her  parents that she wanted to return home to California with her father. She was  insistent. The police were called and interviewed the parties separately. M.  stayed with the respondent who delayed his return to California to January 4,  2021 to see if M. changed her mind. She continued to be insistent that she  wanted to return to her home in California with her father. The claimant did  not consent to her doing so. [20]     On January 4, 2021, the respondent drove with M. across the US border. M.  did not have any travel documentation because it was in the possession of the  claimant. Both M. and the respondent were questioned extensively by customs  officers regarding the appropriateness of them returning to California with her  father without any travel documentation. The questioning lasted two-and-a-half  hours, during which time customs officers were apprised of the claimant\u2019s lack  of consent. The officers nevertheless allowed the respondent and M. to enter  the United States. They arrived home on January 5, 2021. [21]     On January 6, 2021, the claimant filed a notice of family claim as  well as this application. Her counsel appeared before Justice Skolrood of  this court on an  ex parte  basis. Justice Skolrood declined to hear the  application on an  ex parte  basis but did grant the claimant short leave  to serve the materials upon the respondent for today\u2019s hearing.  [22]     The respondent filed his application response on January 8, 2021. On  that same day, despite having previously agreed that C. could stay in BC with  the claimant, he filed an Article 16 Notice under the Hague Convention, seeking  an order returning C. to California. The Article 16 Notice will be heard in BC  by way of petition, which I am told will be filed by the respondent shortly. [23]     The claimant has deposed that she and the children have been victims of  a history of physical and emotional abuse at the hands of the respondent. The  respondent denies physically or emotionally abusing any of them. Given the  state of the conflicting evidence this court is in no position today to make  any determination regarding whether or not the respondent is responsible for  family violence. [24]     M. has been what the parties describe as a \u201chandful\u201d for the parties for  many months, if not years. She has gotten angry, talked back, and lashed out  at her parents on many occasions. She suffers from gender-identity issues.   She has expressed suicidal ideations to the parties. In the fall of 202,0  while in BC, she commenced an assessment program at the BC Children\u2019s Hospital,  although she only attended one appointment prior to her returning to California  on January 4, 2021. The respondent has deposed that since returning to  California, M. has been happy, healthy, and has not expressed any further  suicidal thoughts. [25]     Articles 3 and 16 of the Hague Convention provide in relevant part that,  3: 3. The removal or retention of a child is to be  considered wrongful where:  (a) it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a  person and institution or any other body, either jointly or alone, under the  law of the state in which the child was habitually resident immediate by before  the removal or retention, and (b) at the time of removal or retention, those rights were  actually exercised, either jointly or alone, or would have been so exercised  but for the removal or retention. The rights of custody mentioned in subparagraph (a) above may  arise in particular by operation of law or by reason of judicial administrative  decision or by reason of an agreement having legal effect under the law of that  state. 16. After receiving notice  of a wrongful removal or retention of a child in the sense of article 3, the  judicial or administrative authority is of the contracting state to which the  child has been removed or which it has been retained shall not decide on the  merits of rights of custody until it has been determined that the child is not  to be returned under this convention or unless an application under this  convention is not lodged within a reasonable time following receipt of the  notice. [26]     The parties have had joint custodial and parenting rights with respect  to the children since their birth. Since 2013, they have lived with the  children in California and have exercised those joint custodial and parenting  rights in that jurisdiction, where M. has been habitually resident since she  was two years old. After the claimant travelled to BC with the children in mid  June 2020, she decided to relocate permanently here. Although the respondent  initially insisted that the claimant and the children return to California, he  eventually capitulated and agreed not to oppose them staying in BC. However,  he made it clear he was not prepared to relinquish his rights as a custodial  parent. [27]     As the Article 16 Notice relates only to C., I find it is not a  significant consideration in determining the merits of the claimant\u2019s  application. Rather, I agree with claimant\u2019s counsel that the application must  be determined under s. 77 of the  Family Law Act , S.B.C. 2011, c. 25  [ FLA ], which has become known as the  FLA \u2019s equivalent to Article  16. The issues to be determined is whether it is in the best interests of M.  to make an interim order that she be returned to BC. [28]     Although the respondent did acquiesce in the children staying in BC, once  M. defiantly made it clear she did not wish to stay here, that consent yielded  to M.\u2019s insistent wishes. I am satisfied, on the evidence as a whole that M.  made it clear to the parties in early January 2021 that it was her strong  desire to return home to California with her father.  [29]     It goes without saying that although, generally speaking, a child of  nine years of age may be entitled to a voice, she is not entitled to a choice.   However, in the circumstances of this case, I find that her voice is,  nevertheless, a factor that must be considered when determining her best  interests.  [30]     That said, however, in my view there is simply insufficient evidence  before the court to enable it to make a determination as to the best interests  of M. The evidence in this case regarding whether it is in M.\u2019s best interests  to stay with her father in California or be ordered to return to her mother in BC  is that of the parties alone. Each of them contradicts the other. There is no  independent, objective evidence upon which an accurate assessment can be made. [31]     I am guided in this case by the comments of Justice Marzari in the  decision of this court in  Price v. Srivastva , 2020 BCSC 1109, at paras.  41 to 44 inclusive: [41] Division 7 of Part 4 of the  FLA  governs  jurisdictional issues with respect to guardianship, parenting arrangements, or  contact with the children. Section 74(3) of the  FLA  contains a  forum  non conveniens  provision: (3) A court may decline to make an order under this Part if  the court considers that it is more appropriate for jurisdiction to be  exercised outside British Columbia.  [42] In assessing whether the court should decline to  exercise jurisdiction with respect to guardianship, parenting arrangements, or  contact, it is useful to consider the purposes set out in s. 73 of the  FLA :    73 The purposes of this Division are as follows:  (a) to ensure that court applications respecting  guardianship, parenting arrangements or contact with a child are determined on  the basis of the best interests of the child; (b) to avoid the making of orders respecting guardianship,  parenting arrangements or contact with a child, respecting the same child, in  more than one jurisdiction; (c) to discourage child abduction as an alternative to  determining by due process the guardianship of, or parenting arrangements with  respect to, a child; (d) to provide for effective enforcement of orders  respecting guardianship, parenting arrangements or contact with a child, and  for the recognition and enforcement of extraprovincial orders.  [43] The factors that apply on a  forum non conveniens   analysis, and which are engaged under s. 74(3) of the  FLA , are  codified in s. 11 of the  CJPTA: Shortridge\u2011Tsuchiya  [ v.  Tsuchiya , 2010 BCCA 61] at para. 60. Section 11 of the  CJPTA   provides as follows:  Discretion as to the exercise of territorial competence 11 (1) After considering the interests of the parties to a  proceeding and the ends of justice, a court may decline to exercise its  territorial competence in the proceeding on the ground that a court of another  state is a more appropriate forum in which to hear the proceeding.  (2) A court, in deciding the question of whether it or a  court outside British Columbia is the more appropriate forum in which to hear a  proceeding, must consider the circumstances relevant to the proceeding,  including (a) the comparative convenience and expense for the parties  to the proceeding and for their witnesses, in litigating in the court or in any  alternative forum, (b) the law to be applied to issues in the proceeding,  (c) the desirability of avoiding multiplicity of legal  proceedings,  (d) the desirability of avoiding conflicting decisions in  different courts,  (e) the enforcement of an eventual judgment, and  (f) the fair and efficient working of the Canadian legal  system as a whole.  [44] These factors are not  exhaustive. In determining whether to decline jurisdiction, the court can  consider other relevant factors such as the purposes set out in s. 73 of  the  FLA , including the best interest of the children:  Shortridge\u2011Tsuchiya   at para. 61. [32]     Many of those factors are neutral in this case. However, having  considered those that are relevant and must be considered, which I have done, I  agree with respondent\u2019s counsel that this court should decline to exercise  territorial competence under both s. 74(3) of the  FLA  and s. 11  of the  Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings Transfer Act , S.B.C. 2003, c.  28 in favour of the courts of California. [33]     This was not a case of \u201cabduction\u201d in the usual sense. A proceeding was  commenced in California by the respondent in November of 2020. It was served  on the claimant on December 11, 2020. The claimant has attorned to that  jurisdiction by responding to the proceeding. It is desirable that multiple  proceedings between two jurisdictions be avoided. There will be no difficulty  enforcing the eventual judgment in BC. The comparative convenience and expense  for the parties and their witnesses likely favours California when the parties  and their children have resided there for the past seven years. [34]     In my view, California is the appropriate forum in this case.   Accordingly, the claimant\u2019s application is dismissed. [35]     Do the parties wish to address costs?  [SUBMISSIONS  ON COSTS] [36]     THE COURT: Thank you. I have considered the issue of costs already,  and in my view, there was a  bona fide  issue here. There will be no  order as to costs. \u201cG.C. Weatherill J.\u201d",

January 8, 2021 Table of Contents Background . 5 Issues . 5 History of the Litigation . 6 The Settlement Agreement . 7 Should the Action be Certified for the Purposes of Settlement? . 8 Should the Settlement Agreement be Approved? . 10 Conclusion . 12 [1] On December 14, 2020, I granted an application pursuant to the C lass Proceedings Act, R.S.B.C, c. 50 [ Act ], for certification of this action as a class proceeding against certain settling defendants, and for approval of the settlement of this action against the settling defendants in accordance with the terms of a settlement agreement, with reasons to follow. These are those reasons. [2] This action concerns the acquisition of shares in 2018 by certain defendants, referred to in the notice of civil claim as the \u201cpurported consultants\u201d, under private placements carried out by certain other corporate issuer defendants, including one of the settling defendants, Beleave Inc. The other settling defendants, Andrew Wnek and Bojan Krasic, were both officers and directors of Beleave Inc. during the relevant time period. I will refer to Beleave Inc., Andrew Wnek, and Bojan Krasic collectively as the \u201cSettling Defendants\u201d. [3] This action arose out of an investigation by the British Columbia Securities Commission (the \u201cSecurities Commission\u201d) into the private placements that are the subject of this action. [4] The plaintiffs allege that the defendants, including the Settling Defendants, participated in an investment scheme carried out in 2018. It is alleged the defendant purported consultants acquired shares in the defendant corporate issuers (including Beleave Inc.) through false pretenses and deception on the public market. This, they claim, resulted in loss and damage to the plaintiffs and other proposed class members who acquired shares in the defendant corporate issuers (including Beleave Inc.) after the deception. [5] The plaintiffs and the Settling Defendants entered into a settlement agreement dated July 31, 2020 (the \u201cSettlement Agreement\u201d). This is the first proposed settlement in this action which continues against the other defendants. [6] On December 14, 2020, the issues before me for determination were: a) Should the action be certified as a class proceeding for the purpose of and in accordance with the Settlement Agreement? If so, should Michael Tietz and Duane Loewen be appointed as representative plaintiffs? b) Should the Settlement Agreement be approved? [7] On November 26, 2018, the Executive Director of the Securities Commission issued a notice of hearing and temporary orders against many of the defendants in this action, including Beleave Inc. The orders included that these defendants cease trading in and were prohibited from purchasing securities of the defendant corporate issuers. [8] On January 15, 2019, the Securities Commission conducted a hearing with regard to extending the temporary orders until the investigation could be completed. The Securities Commission declined to extend the temporary orders against Beleave Inc. and some others. [9] On June 5, 2019, Beleave Inc. entered into a settlement agreement with the Securities Commission. In that settlement it agreed it had participated in conduct abusive to the capital markets and, but for mitigating circumstances, that conduct would otherwise warrant public interest orders against it. [10] This action was filed on July 11, 2019, and service of all defendants was completed in late December 2019. [11] Settlement discussions with plaintiffs\u2019 counsel were initiated by counsel for Beleave Inc. These discussions were premised on the precarious financial condition of Beleave Inc., and the fact that the insurance proceeds, potentially available in respect of the claims, were being diminished by ongoing defence costs relating to the claims. [12] On February 21, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a petition seeking leave pursuant to s. 140.8 of the Securities Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 418, to bring claims for secondary market liability under s. 140.3 of the Securities Act . [13] On June 5, 2020, Beleave Inc. filed for protection under the Companies\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act, R.S.C.1985, c. 36, in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (the \u201cCCAA Proceedings\u201d). At that time the Court granted a stay of proceedings against Beleave Inc. and its officers and directors. [14] Counsel for the plaintiffs, counsel for the Settling Defendants, and counsel for Beleave Inc.\u2019s insurer reached agreement on full terms of the Settlement Agreement in October 2020. [15] Due to the existing CCAA Proceedings and the related stay order, the Settlement Agreement contemplates that Beleave Inc. would first apply to the Ontario Court for an order authorizing it to enter into and execute the Settlement Agreement, an order lifting the stay order for the purposes of seeking approval of the Settlement Agreement, and an order granting certain declaratory to the insurer. [16] On November 16, 2020, the Ontario Court granted the orders sought. On November 30, 2020, the Ontario Court made an order terminating the CCAA Proceedings upon the filing of the monitor\u2019s certificate, an order authorizing Beleave Inc. to file assignments into bankruptcy, and an order for the monitor to act as trustee in bankruptcy. A notice of termination of proceedings was issued by the monitor on December 3, 2020, giving notice that the monitor\u2019s certificate terminating the CCAA Proceedings would be filed on December 15, 2020. [17] Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement the Settling Defendants agree to pay $2,400,000 for the benefit of class members. Upon court approval of the Settlement Agreement, the funds will be placed in a settlement fund held by counsel for the class members. [18] The Settling Defendants also agree to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the plaintiffs in the continued prosecution of the action. These efforts include: a) The production of non-privileged documents relevant to the action. b) Mr. Wnek and Mr. Krasic will each: i. make themselves available for interviews with class counsel which will take place on a single day, will take no more than six hours, and may be transcribed by a court reporter; and ii. make themselves reasonably available to provide evidence at the trial of this action, or provide an affidavit or declaration and attend at a cross-examination in support of the certification of this action or in the event of a summary judgment application brought against the plaintiffs. [19] The Settlement Agreement provides that the plaintiffs will apply to the court after the settlement approval hearing for approval of a settlement administration plan. The Settling Defendants will not have standing to make submissions regarding the settlement administration plan. [20] The plaintiffs and Settling Defendants seek to have the action certified as a class proceeding solely for the purpose of and in accordance with the Settlement Agreement. Counsel referred me to a number of cases that confirm that the court has the authority to certify a claim for the purposes of settlement: Haney Iron Works Ltd. v. Manufacturers Life Insurance Co. , [1998] B.C.J. No. 2936 (S.C.); Bodnar v. The Cash Store Inc. , 2010 BCSC 145 at paras. 15, 32; Wilson v. Depuy International Ltd. , 2018 BCSC 1192 at paras. 49-51. [21] The court also has the power to approve a partial settlement of multi-defendant proceedings and has exercised that power to certify a class proceeding against only some defendants for the purpose of approving a partial settlement of the proceeding with those defendants: Main v. Cadbury Schweppes plc , 2010 BCSC 816 at para. 15; Green v. Tecumseh Products of Canada Limited , 2016 BCSC 217 at paras. 1, 6-15; Cantlie v. Canadian Heating Products Inc. , 2015 BCSC 1225 at paras. 1, 4-6. The court encourages such partial settlements: Sun-Rype Products Ltd. v. Archer Daniels Midland Company , 2010 BCSC 472 at para. 20. [22] Despite the fact that the Settling Defendants consent to certification for settlement purposes the court must still be satisfied that the claim meets the statutory requirements for certification as set out in s. 4(1) of the Act . [23] In the settlement context the requirements for class certification may be relaxed or need not be as rigorously applied: Wilson , at para. 50. [24] Where an action is being certified as a class proceeding only for the purpose of settlement against some defendants a determination that the criteria for certification has been satisfied should be without prejudice to whether those criteria are satisfied for the remaining defendants: Green , at para. 11. That is the case in the application before me. [25] The Settling Defendants consent to the class certification for the purposes of settlement. [26] Taking into consideration the requirements of s. 4(1) of the Act , I am satisfied that this action should be certified as a class action for the purposes of the Settlement Agreement for the following reasons: a) The notice of civil claim discloses causes of action for unlawful conspiracy and fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation. In addition, the plaintiffs propose to bring claims in statutory secondary market liability in respect of the private placements with Beleave Inc. Assuming all the facts pleaded in this action are true, it is not plain and obvious that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim cannot succeed. b) There is an identifiable class of two or more persons (being all persons other than the defendants and any other defined excluded persons) who acquired securities in the defendant corporate issuers at the relevant time periods set out in the notice of civil claim. The defined class is rationally connected to the proposed common issues and provides objective criteria by which individuals can determine if they are members of the class. c) The claims of the class members raises a common issue which, for the purposes of the settlement, is: whether misrepresentations were made in the public disclosure made by Beleave Inc. concerning the private placements as described in the notice of civil claim which closed on April 27, 2018 and June 12, 2018. d) A class proceeding is the preferable procedure for the fair and efficient resolution of the common issues since the common issues predominate over any individual issues to the extent that no other means of resolving the claim would be more practical or efficient. e) The evidence supports my finding that Michael Tietz and Duane Loewen are suitable representative plaintiffs and would fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class, they have proposed a settlement agreement in a workable form for resolving the proceeding, and do not have an interest in the common issues which conflicts with the interests of the other class members. [27] Accordingly, for the purposes of this application, I order that the action be certified as a class action and that Michael Tietz and Duane Loewen are appointed as the representative plaintiffs. [28] The applicable principles for the approval of a settlement under ss. 35(1) and (3) of the Act are summarized in Bodnar, at paras. 16-21 : a) The standard for approval of a settlement is whether the settlement is fair, reasonable, and in the best interests of the class as a whole. b) The court is not required to dissect the proposed settlement with an eye to perfection. Instead, the question is whether the settlement falls within a zone or range of reasonableness. c) The court is not entitled to modify the terms of a negotiated settlement. d) In considering whether to approve a settlement, the court must consider the litigation risks and benefits in proceeding with the action. The court\u2019s function is to determine whether there are any disadvantages to the settlement that are sufficient to justify its rejection. e) Counsel\u2019s recommendation that a settlement be approved should be given significance by the court. When the proposed class settlement has been negotiated at arm\u2019s length by class counsel there is a presumption of fairness. f) In evaluating the reasonableness of a settlement the court may consider evidence concerning the expected participation in the settlement by class members as a factor in assessing the sufficiency of the funds available to compensate class members under the terms of the settlement. [29] The advantages of the Settlement Agreement are: a) The financial benefit to the class of $2,400,000 is significant, particularly given the risks of the action not being successful at the statutory leave stage, certification stage, and at trial and due to the financial circumstances of Beleave Inc. The Settling Defendants are unlikely to have the means to satisfy a judgment for the damages sought by the plaintiffs and continuing with the litigation means the insurance funds will be diminished until little or nothing is left. b) The agreement obliges the Settling Defendants to cooperate in the continued prosecution of the litigation. This is a significant non-monetary benefit to the putative class members. c) Claims of the class members in respect of their purchases of shares in Beleave Inc. will continue against the remaining defendants. This includes those who were involved in the acquisition of shares in Beleave Inc. under the two private placements at issue, those involved in the subsequent sale of the shares, and the other defendants who entered into or arranged the consulting agreements with Beleave Inc. as part of the private placement transactions. d) The Settlement Agreement provides that the plaintiffs will not claim from the remaining defendants any portion of loss that the court may ultimately attribute to the fault of the Settling Defendants, and in those circumstances fairly and properly bars the remaining defendants from making any claims of contribution or indemnity against the Settling Defendants. [30] There do not appear to be any disadvantages to the Settlement Agreement in the circumstances. [31] Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel are experienced class action counsel who pursued the action diligently. All aspects of the Settlement Agreement have been approved by the representative plaintiffs, the Settlement Defendants, and the insurer. [32] Taking the above factors into account and the fact the agreement has been consented to, I am satisfied that the Settlement Agreement is fair and reasonable and in the best interests of those affected by it. [33] The plaintiffs\u2019 application for approval of the Settlement Agreement is granted. [34] The plaintiffs may take their order as sought with the two changes discussed by counsel on December 14, 2020: the changes to paragraph seven as put forth by the defendant PreveCeutical Medical Inc. and the additional order that nothing in the Settlement Agreement derogates from or otherwise limits the plaintiffs\u2019 document production obligations in this action, as consented to by the plaintiffs and the Settling Defendants. \u201cWilkinson J.\u201d",

Lange , 2019 YKCA 2 Date: 20190115 Docket: 15-YU771 Between: Regina Respondent And Mark Lewis Lange Appellant Before: The Honourable Chief Justice Bauman The Honourable Madam Justice Cooper The Honourable Mr. Justice Fitch On appeal from: An order of the Territorial Court of Yukon, dated November 27, 2015 ( R. v. Lange , 2015 YKTC 43, Whitehorse Docket No. 14-00138). Counsel for the Appellant: V. Larochelle Counsel for the Respondent: N. Sinclair Place and Date of Hearing: Whitehorse, Yukon May 11, 2018 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia January 15, 2019 Written Reasons by: The Honourable Madam Justice Cooper The Honourable Mr. Justice Fitch Concurred in by: The Honourable Chief Justice Bauman Summary: The appellant appeals his dangerous offender designation or, alternatively, the imposition of an indeterminate sentence. He says the sentencing judge erred by not providing any or sufficient reasons for the designation and by failing to consider his treatment prospects at the designation stage of the proceedings. The Crown concedes the latter issue, but argues that the dangerous offender designation was the only reasonable outcome. Held: the appeal is allowed. The sentencing judge erred in principle by failing to consider treatment prospects at the designation stage. On the evidence in this case and in the absence of clear factual findings respecting the appellant\u2019s treatment prospects, the Court is unable to conclude that there is no reasonable possibility that a different result would have been reached absent the error. The matter is remitted for a new hearing. Reasons for Judgment of the Honourable Madam Justice Cooper and the Honourable Mr. Justice Fitch: [1] Mr. Mark Lange appeals his dangerous offender designation or, alternatively, the imposition of an indeterminate sentence. For the reasons that follow, we are of the view that the appeal must be allowed, the dangerous offender designation set aside, and the matter remitted for a new hearing. [2] In June of 2014, the appellant was charged with aggravated assault. He subsequently pleaded guilty to the included offence of assault causing bodily harm. The Crown brought an application to have him declared a dangerous offender pursuant to s. 753(1)(a)(i) and (ii) of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 [ Criminal Code ]. On November 27, 2015, the appellant was declared a dangerous offender and sentenced to an indeterminate sentence. The reasons for judgment are indexed as 2015 YKTC 43. [3] For the purposes of the dangerous offender proceeding, the sentencing judge had information regarding the appellant\u2019s prior convictions, which consist of a mix of violent offences, property offences and offences for breaching court orders. To establish the requisite pattern, the Crown relied on the following convictions: \u00b7 1990 (Youth Court): Assault with a weapon (s. 267(1)(a) of the Criminal Code ) \u2013 18 months\u2019 probation; \u00b7 1998: Assault causing bodily harm (s. 267(1)(b) of the Criminal Code ) \u2013 6 months\u2019 imprisonment to be followed by 18 months\u2019 probation; \u00b7 1998: Assault (s. 266 of the Criminal Code ) \u2013 60 days\u2019 imprisonment, consecutive to the sentence being served for assault causing bodily harm; \u00b7 2006: Manslaughter (s. 236 of the Criminal Code) \u2013 9 years and 4 months\u2019 imprisonment; and \u00b7 2014: Uttering threats (s. 264.1(1)(a) of the Criminal Code ) \u2013 75 days\u2019 imprisonment, to be followed by 9 months\u2019 probation. [4] The sentencing judge was provided with numerous documents from prior court proceedings, affidavits and evidence from corrections representatives and, as the appellant is Indigenous, a Gladue report. The sentencing judge also had two psychiatric assessments prepared by forensic psychiatrist Dr. Shabehram Lohrasbe \u2013 one from 2012 and one prepared for the purposes of the 2015 proceedings. The 2015 assessment addressed the prospects of successful treatment of the appellant. [5] In his report, Dr. Lohrasbe stated that while it was possible that Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), and brain injury were present, the risks associated with medicating for any of these diagnoses outweighed any benefits that might be achieved. [6] He determined that the appellant displayed anti-social attitudes, values, and behaviours but that he had responded well to programming in the past and that \u201c[h]e can do better with appropriate guidance in the future.\u201d [7] Alcohol was identified as a factor in the appellant\u2019s criminality. He had periods of sobriety, including an extended period of seven years. A stronger commitment to sobriety would require \u201csupport and supervision, but again it is doable.\u201d Dr. Lohrasbe concluded that, should certain preconditions be met, the appellant could be safely supervised in the community. [8] The sentencing judge reviewed the evidence. He outlined the nature and circumstances of the predicate offence and the prior offences. He discussed the background and personal circumstances of the appellant. He reviewed the treatment which the appellant had undergone over the years and made reference to some of the conclusions in the 2015 psychiatric assessment. The sentencing judge concluded: [47] Based on the analysis of the criminal record and the facts of the predicate offence, the psychiatric assessment report, the other reports and the viva voce testimony, the Court has no hesitation whatsoever in declaring Mr. Lange a dangerous offender under subsections 753(1)(a)(i) and 753(1)(a)(ii) of the Code . [9] Having found Mr. Lange to be a dangerous offender, the sentencing judge proceeded to consider whether there was a reasonable expectation that a sentence other than an indeterminate one would adequately protect the public. He decided that it would not. [10] The issues on this appeal are: 1. Did the sentencing judge err in not providing sufficient reasons? 2. Did the sentencing judge err in not considering prospects for treatment at the designation stage of the proceedings? 3. Did the sentencing judge err in failing to consider whether the predicate offence was part of a broader pattern of violent behaviour? 4. Is the indeterminate sentence demonstrably unfit? [11] The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code provide: Application for finding that an offender is a dangerous offender 753 (1) On application made under this Part after an assessment report is filed under subsection 752.1(2), the court shall find the offender to be a dangerous offender if it is satisfied (a) that the offence for which the offender has been convicted is a serious personal injury offence described in paragraph (a) of the definition of that expression in section 752 and the offender constitutes a threat to the life, safety or physical or mental well-being of other persons on the basis of evidence establishing (i) a pattern of repetitive behaviour by the offender, of which the offence for which he or she has been convicted forms a part, showing a failure to restrain his or her behaviour and a likelihood of causing death or injury to other persons, or inflicting severe psychological damage on other persons, through failure in the future to restrain his or her behaviour, (ii) a pattern of persistent aggressive behaviour by the offender, of which the offence for which he or she has been convicted forms a part, showing a substantial degree of indifference on the part of the offender respecting the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his or her behaviour, or (iii) any behaviour by the offender, associated with the offence for which he or she has been convicted, that is of such a brutal nature as to compel the conclusion that the offender\u2019s behaviour in the future is unlikely to be inhibited by normal standards of behavioural restraint; or \u2026 Sentence for dangerous offender (4) If the court finds an offender to be a dangerous offender, it shall (a) impose a sentence of detention in a penitentiary for an indeterminate period; (b) impose a sentence for the offence for which the offender has been convicted \u2014 which must be a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of two years \u2014 and order that the offender be subject to long-term supervision for a period that does not exceed 10 years; or (c) impose a sentence for the offence for which the offender has been convicted. Sentence of indeterminate detention (4.1) The court shall impose a sentence of detention in a penitentiary for an indeterminate period unless it is satisfied by the evidence adduced during the hearing of the application that there is a reasonable expectation that a lesser measure under paragraph (4)(b) or (c) will adequately protect the public against the commission by the offender of murder or a serious personal injury offence. [12] The sentencing judge did not have the benefit of the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision in R. v. Boutilier , 2017 SCC 64, which confirmed that s. 753(1) of the Criminal Code \u2013 the designation stage of the dangerous offender proceedings \u2013 requires the court to consider an offender\u2019s future treatment prospects. The failure to do so constitutes error in principle. [13] The Crown concedes that the sentencing judge erred by failing to consider treatment prospects at the designation stage. The Crown argues, however, that based on the evidence, the only reasonable result was the dangerous offender designation. The Crown urges the Court to dismiss the appeal. [14] Having found that the sentencing judge erred, the Court can dismiss the appeal if there is no reasonable possibility that the verdict would have been any different had the error of law not been made: R. v. Johnson , 2003 SCC 46 at para. 49. In this case, it is not possible for the Court to determine what the verdict would have been if the judge had not erred because he failed to give sufficient reasons for his decision. Thus, the second ground of appeal is inextricably connected with the first. [15] There was evidence before the sentencing judge regarding the appellant\u2019s treatment prospects in the form of Dr. Lohrasbe\u2019s assessment report. Dr. Lohrasbe\u2019s conclusions on the subject of treatability were as follows: To summarize treatability: Mr. Lange has engaged with and benefited from programs in the past. While his relapse into substance abuse and his violence are of obvious concern, it does not follow that further treatment interventions are worthless. It is a lamentable fact that such relapses occur with some frequency (\u2018old habits die hard\u2019). In my opinion, given his strengths but acknowledging the long road he has ahead of him, it is still reasonable to hypothesize that with further treatment interventions, and further growth on his part, his risk could be reduced to levels that can be managed in the community in the foreseeable future. Such interventions should not be focused on what he has (as much as such would be his preference), but on who he is , what he does , and the way he approaches and responds to what he encounters in the future. \u2026 \u2026To safely supervise an offender such as Mr. Lange in the community, there has to be a strong alliance between him and his supervisors. Such an alliance is based on Mr. Lange moving toward openness, honesty, disclosiveness, and behavioural cooperation. If he continues to harbour hostility toward representatives \u2018of the system\u2019, and mistrusts the individuals charged with his monitoring and supervision in the community, risk management will be problematic\u2026 He is very cognisant of the fact that current sentencing proceedings mean that he has \u2018run out of chances\u2019, and that any further acts of significant violence may result in a lengthy incarceration. His \u2018jailhouse fatigue\u2019 and his knowledge that he will have no more chances may be strong motivators for treatment and for compliance with supervision. He is mindful that he had been given the opportunity to redeem himself and has failed. He is aware that time is running out for him to put his talents [as an artist] at the forefront of his identity. Such awareness is likely to assist in motivation for renewed efforts to examine and shift his attitudes. If he engages in the treatment programs that will be offered to him and learns that he benefits through cooperation and compliance, he may gradually come to see that \u2018the system\u2019 shares with him the goal of keeping him out of jails and prisons. It is then that the combination of aging, maturity, \u2018burnout\u2019, and close monitoring of his commitment to abstinence may be sufficient for safe risk management in the community. [Emphasis in original] [16] The assessment report concluded with a summary, which stated: At present and in the foreseeable future: A. Mr. Lange will pose a high risk for violence. B. Further engagement in therapeutic programs available within the penitentiary system are likely to be of assistance in reducing risk. The goal would be to get him to the point where managing his risk in the community can reasonably be envisioned. C. Before risk management in the community can be contemplated, Mr. Lange will need to have a track record of cooperation, honesty, and disclosure. D. To manage his risk in the community, his supervisors would need to have a high level of confidence that Mr. Lange is genuine and steadfast in his commitment to total abstinence from alcohol and all intoxicants. E. Such preconditions to safe management in the community, while challenging, are not outside the realm of reasonable possibility. F. When Mr. Lange is released into the community, the lengthier the period of parole, the greater the chances of preventing further violence, through a combination of monitoring, supervision, therapy, and victim safety planning. [17] Dr. Lohrasbe\u2019s report was supplemented by his testimony given during the hearing. [18] In cross-examination of Dr. Lohrasbe, defence counsel highlighted factors that had the potential to positively impact the appellant\u2019s prospects for successful treatment. These included the motivation for change provided by the court proceedings; further engagement in programming while incarcerated; the appellant\u2019s intellectual curiosity and understanding that he is becoming institutionalized, which speak to his insight; the gains he made while previously incarcerated; his age; his acceptance of responsibility; and the benefits of a supportive transitional period upon release. [19] Dr. Lohrasbe\u2019s cross-examination concluded with the following exchange: Q And so would it be your opinion that, if, given all of these positive features and assuming for argument[\u2019s] sake, his acceptance of treatment and programming and engagement that is it your opinion that there would be a reasonable expectation he could be managed in the community? A Yes. [Emphasis added.] [20] Thus, Dr. Lohrasbe\u2019s conclusion was that successful treatment was a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d, or that there was a \u201creasonable expectation\u201d of successful treatment, if the appellant committed himself to a treatment program; established a track record of cooperation, honesty, and disclosure; and was committed to total abstinence from alcohol and all intoxicants. Given this evidence, it was incumbent upon the sentencing judge to make factual findings regarding the appellant\u2019s ability to achieve the preconditions and be successfully treated. Depending on how the sentencing judge assessed the evidence, a finding that the Crown had not discharged its onus for the appellant to be designated a dangerous offender was a reasonably possible outcome. [21] Regrettably, although the sentencing judge reviewed Dr. Lohrasbe\u2019s evidence, he did not make findings of fact in relation to it. It is not possible to determine from the reasons for sentence what he considered to be the likelihood of the appellant achieving the pre-conditions to successful treatment, nor is it possible to determine, if those pre-conditions were met, what he considered to be the likelihood of successful treatment. [22] In this respect, the case at bar differs from R. v. Wesley , 2018 ONCA 636 at para. 17, and R. v. Malakpour , 2018 BCCA 254 at paras. 95\u201398. In each of these cases, the sentencing judge made findings of fact that the appellate court was able to assess in the context of the applicable law and determine that the result would not have been different had the sentencing judge properly considered treatability at the designation stage. We do not have the benefit of such findings. [23] The sentencing judge erred in principle by failing to consider treatment prospects at the designation stage. Given the evidence in this case, it cannot be said there is no reasonable possibility of a different result had the error not been made. In the absence of clear factual findings on this critical issue, it is our view that the Court is not in a position to affirm the dangerous offender finding nor is it in a position to substitute for the dangerous offender finding a finding that the appellant is a long-term offender. Unfortunately, a new hearing before a different judge is required and we would make that order under s. 759(3)(a)(ii) of the Criminal Code . [24] Given the findings on the first two grounds of appeal it is unnecessary to consider the remaining grounds. \u201cThe Honourable Madam Justice Cooper\u201d \u201cThe Honourable Mr. Justice Fitch\u201d I AGREE: \u201cThe Honourable Chief Justice Bauman\u201d",

        "text": "IN THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA Citation: R. v. Chamberlain, 2019 BCSC 84 Date: 20190109 Docket: 27655-1 Registry: Vancouver Regina v. Colt Montgomery Chamberlain Before: The Honourable Associate Chief Justice H. Holmes On appeal from: Provincial Court of British Columbia ( R. v. Chamberlain , Richmond File No. AJ04497047) Oral Reasons for Judgment Counsel for Crown (Respondent): M.L. Crisp Counsel for Appellant: S.R. Chamberlain, QC Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, B.C. January 9, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, B.C. January 9, 2019 [1] Colt Chamberlain appeals his conviction by a judicial justice of the peace for speeding against a highway sign, contrary to s. 146(3) of the Motor Vehicle Act . [2] The only witness in the trial was Constable Towns, who issued the traffic violation ticket to Mr. Chamberlain. His unchallenged evidence was that he estimated Mr. Chamberlain\u2019s driving speed at 143 km/h, and that his radar device gave a reading of 145 km/h. Mr. Chamberlain was driving northbound on Highway 91 in Delta, BC, just south of the 64 th Avenue overpass, in an area where, it is the Crown\u2019s position, a speed limit of 90 km/h applies. [3] The main issue in the appeal is whether the evidence in the trial established beyond a reasonable doubt that a speed sign had been placed by the minister responsible for the administration of the Transportation Act. The Crown agrees that this is an essential element of the offence. [4] Mr. Chamberlain would also raise a new issue, which was not raised in the trial, of whether the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that any such sign, if one was in place, applied to his path of travel. [5] Speeding offences are addressed in s. 146 of the Motor Vehicle Act . Subsection (1) sets out \u201cdefault\u201d speed limits of 50 km/h in a municipality or treaty lands, and 80 km/h outside a municipality. Subsection (2) allows the minister responsible for the administration of the Transportation Act to erect or place a sign setting a higher or lower speed limit than those default limits. Subsection (3), which Mr. Chamberlain was charged with contravening, provides that it is an offence to drive at a higher rate of speed than indicated on a sign erected or placed by the minister. Those provisions read as follows: 146(1) Subject to this section, a person must not drive or operate a motor vehicle on a highway in a municipality or treaty lands at a greater rate of speed than 50 km/h, and a person must not drive or operate a motor vehicle on a highway outside a municipality at a greater rate of speed than 80 km/h. (2) The minister responsible for the administration of the Transportation Act may, by causing a sign to be erected or placed on a highway limiting the rate of speed of motor vehicles or a category of motor vehicles driven or operated on that portion of the highway, increase or decrease the rate of speed at which a person may drive or operate a motor vehicle or a category of motor vehicle on that portion of the highway. (3) If the minister responsible for the administration of the Transportation Act has caused a sign to be erected or placed on a highway limiting the rate of speed of motor vehicles or a category of motor vehicles driven or operated on that portion of the highway, a person must not, when the sign is in place on the highway, drive or operate a vehicle on that portion of the highway at a greater rate of speed than that indicated on the sign for that category of motor vehicle. [6] As I noted earlier, Mr. Chamberlain submits that the evidence did not establish beyond a reasonable doubt, for the purposes of s. 146(3), that a 90 km/h sign had been erected or placed by the minister. [7] I should note that it was tacitly acknowledged that the minister may erect or place a sign through delegates or employees \u2013 there was no suggestion that the minister must do so personally. [8] The evidence Constable Towns gave about the speed signs he evidently thought to apply was as follows: As I proceeded to my enforcement location, I confirmed that the posted signage in the area read 90 kilometres an hour. Two lanes north, two lanes south. The signs were clear and posted and had not been removed since the previous shift . I was stationary, parked facing west in the unmarked police vehicle so I could target northbound traffic on the two lanes of Highway 91. The conditions this day were cloudy but wet. We were on an asphalt road surface and it was the daytime. This is Highway 91 northbound, just south of 64 th Avenue overpass in the City of Delta, British Columbia. As I was monitoring traffic for vehicles that I felt to be travelling above the posted speed limit of 90 kilometres an hour , a vehicle was fast approaching that I observed in lane one. I described the vehicle as a grey Sedan with LED-style daytime running lights. [emphasis added] [9] This evidence thus did not expressly address whether the speed signs to which Constable Towns referred had been placed by the minister. [10] The Crown submits that s. 201 of the Act applies to provide the evidence that Constable Towns did not expressly give. Section 201 reads as follows: 201 The existence of a sign permitted by this Act and purporting to regulate the use of the highway in any manner is evidence the sign was duly erected and maintained by the proper authority under this Act and in accordance with this Act and the regulations. [11] Where s. 201 applies, it relieves the Crown (absent evidence to the contrary) of having to prove that that the sign was duly erected and maintained by the proper authority under the Act , and that the sign accorded with the Act and the regulations. [12] In my view \u2013 and I did not take there to be disagreement on this \u2013 the minister is a \u201cproper authority\u201d under the Act , and s. 201, if it applies, will thus relieve the Crown of having to prove that a speed sign was erected or placed by the minister. [13] The parties disagree about whether the evidence in the trial was sufficient to engage s. 201. [14] Counsel agree that s. 201 is engaged only where there is evidence of a sign \u201cpermitted by this Act and purporting to regulate the use of the highway in any manner\u201d. That portion of s. 201 involves two components: (1) that the sign was \u201cpermitted by this Act\u201d; and (2) that the sign was \u201cpurporting to regulate the use of the highway\u201d. [15] The second component is not in issue in this appeal. There is no suggestion that the sign on which Constable Towns relied in concluding that the speed limit was 90 km/h was not a sign \u201cpurporting to regulate the use of the highway\u201d. [16] The dispute between the parties relates to the first component, namely whether the speed sign was \u201cpermitted by this Act\u201d. More specifically, the issue is whether Constable Towns gave evidence from which the judicial justice of the peace could reasonably have concluded that there was such a sign. [17] So I turn to address what \u201cpermitted by this Act\u201d means. [18] Mr. Chamberlain submits that a sign \u201cpermitted by this Act\u201d means a sign that complies with the Act and the regulations. The regulations include numerous mandatory requirements for the size, shape, and other features of speed signs. Mr. Chamberlain submits that s. 201 is not engaged unless there is some evidence that the sign in question met those requirements. [19] I cannot agree. Such an interpretation would effectively defeat the purpose of s. 201, because s. 201 would be engaged only where the Crown proves the very features of a sign that s. 201 is designed to relieve the Crown from proving. [20] I conclude that, in the present context, a sign \u201cpermitted by this Act\u201d means a sign permitted by s. 146(2). As I noted earlier, s. 146(2) permits the minister to erect or place a speed sign that increases or decreases the default speed limit that would otherwise apply by virtue of s. 146(1). [21] The next question is this: for a sign to be \u201cpermitted by\u201d s. 146(2), must there be evidence that the minister erected or placed the sign? After all, the language of s. 146(2) begins with, \u201cThe minister responsible for the administration of the Transportation Act may, by causing a sign to be erected or placed \u2026\u201d. One could read the provision as requiring evidence that it was the minister who erected or placed the sign, in order for the sign to be viewed as \u201cpermitted\u201d for the purposes of s. 201. [22] However, in my view, such an interpretation would \u2013 like the interpretation put forward by Mr. Chamberlain that I discussed above \u2013 defeat the purpose of s. 201. In addition to relieving the Crown of the requirement to prove that the sign complied with the Act and the regulations, s. 201 relieves the Crown of the requirement to prove that the sign was \u201cduly erected \u2026 by the proper authority\u201d. This aspect of s. 201 is clearly intended to relieve the Crown of proving the minister\u2019s involvement in the erecting or placing of the sign. [23] In my view, the evidence required to engage s. 201 is, simply, that there was a speed sign. On the basis of that evidence, s. 201 then provides that (absent evidence to the contrary) the sign was \u201cduly erected \u2026 by the proper authority\u201d, who, in this context, is the minister. Section 201 similarly provides that the sign accords with the requirements of the Act and the regulations. [24] Constable Towns\u2019 evidence about the posted speed signs, taken in conjunction with s. 201, was therefore sufficient to establish that the sign was erected or placed by the minister. [25] But even if s. 201 was unavailable to the Crown, and the Crown was therefore obliged to prove that the signs were erected or placed by the minister, I cannot agree with Mr. Chamberlain that the evidence was insufficient. [26] It is true that Constable Towns made no express reference, in his evidence, to the minister (or any delegates or employees of the minister) having had any involvement in placing the sign. He also gave no description of the signs in a way that made clear that they met the detailed requirements of the regulations (so as to support an inference that it must have been the minister who erected them). [27] But in my view, the body of evidence as a whole allowed for the reasonable inference that the signs to which Constable Towns referred were signs placed by the minister. This was the inference that the judicial justice of the peace evidently drew: THE COURT: Well, at the risk of contradicting other courts, I do not agree with you, Mr. Chamberlain. Section [201] is the presumption section, that is, a presumption of regularity of the sign and the schedules which describe the sign is just simply \u2013 describe how they must \u2013 how they must look and I am satisfied that where the officer says that the posted speed \u2013 it was 90 kilometres in that \u2013 that is sufficient evidence in this case. MR. CHAMBERLAIN: But I think you\u2019ve missed \u2013 the one provision says that the sign shall conform, which is mandatory. THE COURT: Yes. That is what it is saying. I mean, if there was some other weird sign up, I am sure the officer would have told us or somebody would have told us but, to the officer, that was a regular posted speed limit. That is the tenor of his evidence. I am sure if it was a tiny 90K or something, he would say what, and then he would have noticed that. So I think the tenor of his evidence is it is a regular posted 90 kilometre sign and that is the tenor of his evidence but I accept that. [emphasis added] [28] Constable Towns had given his evidence about the signs in the context of his role as a traffic enforcement officer with seven years of experience. His evidence had made clear that he was familiar with the speed signs in the area from at least one previous work shift. He had testified that he checked before beginning his speed enforcement duties on the day in question to make sure that the usual signs were in place. The judicial justice of the peace reasonably inferred that Constable Towns took the signs that he testified he saw as being ordinary or standard highway speed signs, namely signs erected or placed by the minister. [29] As I have explained, I do not consider it necessary for the Crown to have led evidence that the signs were erected or placed by the minister, because with evidence of a speed sign, s. 201 provided that evidence and nothing contradicted it. [30] However, even if evidence was necessary, I cannot conclude that the judicial justice of the peace was unreasonable or clearly wrong in his conclusion from the evidence that the signs to which Constable Towns referred were ordinary speed signs that had been erected or placed by the minister. [31] I turn, then, to whether the evidence established that the speed signs applied to the portion of the highway on which Mr. Chamberlain was driving. Mr. Chamberlain submits that it did not. [32] The Crown objects to this issue being raised because it was not raised in the trial. The Crown submits that Mr. Chamberlain has not met the test for raising a new issue outlined in R. v. Widdifield , 2016 BCCA 322 at para. 51. [33] It is unnecessary to determine whether the test in Widdifield is met because in my view Mr. Chamberlain cannot succeed on this issue, even if it is permitted to be raised. [34] My reasons are very similar to some of those I have given in relation to the first issue. [35] The judicial justice of the peace evidently concluded from the evidence as a whole that a 90 km/h speed sign applied to Mr. Chamberlain\u2019s path of travel. He had a basis in the evidence for this conclusion. Before and after referring to \u201c[t]wo lanes north, two lanes south\u201d on the highway, Constable Towns referred to \u201cthe posted signage in the area\u201d, and to the \u201cclear and posted\u201d signs that had not been removed since the previous shift. In his enforcement duties that day, Constable Towns was targeting the two northbound lanes, \u201cmonitoring traffic for vehicles that [he] felt to be travelling above the posted speed limit\u201d. He noticed Mr. Chamberlain\u2019s vehicle fast approaching in one of the northbound lanes, and took steps to first estimate and then measure its speed. Constable Towns testified that from his laser equipment he obtained a reading of \u201c145 kilometres an hour in a posted 90 kilometres an hour zone \u201d [emphasis added]. [36] In my view, the only reasonable conclusion from the evidence is that a sign limiting vehicles\u2019 speed to 90 km/h applied to Mr. Chamberlain\u2019s path of travel. [37] The appeal is dismissed. \u201cThe Honourable Associate Chief Justice H. Holmes\u201d",

Bilawich Counsel for the applicant Ingrid Reid: Jeffrey Locke Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, B.C. January 15, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, B.C. January 16, 2019 [1] The deceased, Mr. Nieweler, died on June 10, 2015 leaving a will naming his three children, Ingrid, Edward and Stephan as co-executors. I will continue to refer to them by their first names. [2] Stephan and Edward apply to remove Ingrid as executor. After being served with Stephan's application, Ingrid applied to remove Stephan. [3] Stephan's Notice of Application fairly sets out the background facts and what follows is largely drawn from it. [4] Mr. Nieweler left a will dated January 24, 2013 (the \"Will\") naming Ingrid, Edward and Stephan as co-executors / co-trustees of his estate. The Will does not contain a \"majority\" clause, so the three co-executors are obliged to act unanimously in the discharge of their duties and obligations. [ 5 ] The Will provides that the residue of the deceased's estate is to be divided into three equal shares and that one such share goes to each of Ingrid, Edward and Stephan. [ 6 ] On December 23, 2015, the Court granted probate of the Will appointing Ingrid, Edward and Stephan as co-executors. [7] When Mr. Nieweler died, his estate included: \u00b7 His residence at 486 Montroyal Place, North Vancouver. (This has since been sold.) \u00b7 12,500 out of the 50,002 common voting shares in Bastion Inn Ltd. and the only preferred share of Bastion. \u00b7 100 out of the 110 common voting shares in Montroyal Enterprises Ltd. (\"Montroyal\"). (Ingrid, Edward and Stephan held, respectively, four, three and three shares personally.) \u00b7 All of the 100 common voting shares in Hermann's Jazz Club Inc. (the \"Pub\"). On March 30, 2016, these shares were transferred equally (33-1/3 shares each) to Ingrid, Edward and Stephan; \u00b7 All of the 360 common voting shares in Hermann's Jazz Inc. (the \"Jazz Club\"). On March 30, 2016 these were transferred equally to Ingrid, Edward and Stephan. [8] Montroyal holds 37,502 of the 50,002 common voting shares of Bastion Inn. [9] After Ingrid, Edward and Stephan became co-executors, the estate's lawyer, Mr. Lenaghan, arranged to have the deceased's shares in all four companies transferred to them as co-executors and to have all three appointed directors and officers of each of the four companies. [10] Bastion Inn owns a commercial property at 751/753 View Street, Victoria, BC (the \"View Street Property\"). The 2011 appraised value per a marketing proposal was $3.55 million. [11] The View Street Property has two stories and a third-floor mezzanine. When Mr. Nieweler died, the second floor and third-floor mezzanine were leased to 1972 Productions Inc. o/a \"Touch Lounge\". The ground floor was occupied by the Pub and Jazz Club. [12] After Mr. Nieweler's death, Ingrid and her husband Fraser Reid, an accountant, unilaterally carried out a financial reorganization of the Pub and Jazz Club. As a result, the original \"Hermann's Jazz Club\" business is currently owned and operated by the newer of the two operating companies (incorporated in 2014) and the newer pub business is shown as being owned and operated by the older company (incorporated in 2004). They did not seek Stephan's input or consent before doing so. [13] The Pub is an 80-seat operation. The Jazz Club is a 150-seat operation. They share a common kitchen. Neither has a formal written lease with Bastion Inn. [14] Bastion Inn holds three liquor licences for the View Street Property. [15] The original Hermann's Jazz Club business was Mr. Nieweler's passion, shared by Stephan. Prior to Mr. Nieweler's death, Stephan was actively involved in all aspects of the operation and management of the business and involved in the creation of the new pub business. Neither Ingrid nor Edward were particularly involved while the deceased was alive. [16] Within days following Mr. Nieweler's death, Ingrid and Mr. Reid took possession of financial records for all four companies and relocated them to their home in Surrey, despite objections. Stephan wanted accounting functions to continue to be handled by the bookkeepers and accountants the deceased had been dealing with. [17] I will not detail the machinations but as things currently stand, the estate still owns shares in Bastion Inn and Montroyal. The shares formerly owned in the Pub and Jazz Club were transferred to Ingrid, Edward and Stephan in their personal capacities. The View Street Property is the largest remaining asset in the deceased's estate. [ 18 ] The beneficiaries started to disagree with respect to the handling of the estate shortly after their father died. [19] Stephan commenced two petitions seeking to address his exclusion from having a management role in the two estate-controlled companies, Bastion Inn and Montroyal and claiming an oppression remedy relating to the Pub and Jazz Club. [20] On March 6, 2017, before the Petitions had been scheduled for hearing on their merits, Ingrid and Mr. Reid requested a delay because of the death of their son. Stephan agreed and both Petitions were put on hold. [21] In late March 2017, Stephan and Edward began exploring ways to reach a consensus and begin working cooperatively. This eventually led to Edward and Stephan reaching an agreement to settle the dispute, which was then presented to and accepted by Ingrid (in June 2017). [22] The applicants rely on: \u00b7 Sections 158 and 159 of the Wills, Estates and Succession Act , S.B.C. 2009, c. 13; \u00b7 Section 30 of the Trustee Act , R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 464; \u00b7 The inherent jurisdiction of the court. [23] The parties are agreed on the law relating to the removal of a trustee. [24] Section 158(2) of WESA provides: 158(2) A person having an interest in an estate may apply to the court to remove or pass over a person otherwise entitled to be or to become a personal representative. [25] Section 159 (1) of WESA provides 159(1) If the court discharges or removes a personal representative, the court (a) must appoint another person who consents to act as the substitute personal representative, unless (i) the administration of the estate is complete, or (ii) the court does not consider a new appointment necessary, and ... [26] Finally, s. 30 of the Trustee Act provides: A trustee or receiver appointed by any court may be removed and a trustee, trustees or receiver substituted in place of him or her, at any time on application to the court by any trust beneficiary who is not under legal disability, with the consent and approval of a majority in interest and number of the trust beneficiaries who are also not under legal disability. [27] A testator is entitled to appoint the executor(s) he chooses and that discretion will not be lightly interfered with: DeCotiis v. DeCotiis , 2008 BCSC 1206. [28] The Will does not contain a majority clause, which means that the co-executors are obliged to act unanimously: Clock Holdings Ltd. v. Braich Estate , 2008 BCSC 1697 at para. 16. [ 29 ] Animosity between the executor and a beneficiary alone is not on its own sufficient to warrant removal of an executor: Letterstedt v. Broers (1884), 9 A.C. 371 at 389 (P.C.); see also 385\u20136. However, animosity between co-executors can be relevant to whether it is reasonable to expect they can work effectively and efficiently together to carry out their duties. Thus, in Levi-Bandel v. McKeen , 2011 BCSC 247, Mr. Justice Butler removed a co-executrix to address paralysis arising from difficulties between co-executors: [21 ] However, it is not only an act of misconduct that can be grounds for removal of a trustee. A failure to act can amount to grounds for removal. In Scott v. Scott , [1991] 5 W.W.R. 185 (Sask. Q.B.), Baynton, J. relied on the inherent jurisdiction of the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench to remove a trustee where the actions of one trustee in refusing to sign cheques or provide an accounting produced a stalemate amongst the trustees. His refusal was motivated by his wish to be compensated by the trust for caring for one of the principals of the trust. He refused to sign cheques or provide the accounting until he was paid. The court found that the trustee's deliberate failure to act placed him in breach of his fiduciary duties to the beneficiaries of the trust. [22 ] The actions of Ms. McKeen have some similarity to the actions of the trustee in Scott . The delays in responding to requests for information and the refusal to meet to discuss legitimate issues impeded the administration of the estate. The cause of the difficulties appears to have been Ms. McKeen's request for reimbursement of expenses, along with the difficulties regarding the Cat Bequest. [23 ] Matters were further complicated by her threatened claim against the estate for an alleged personal injury. I have little difficulty in concluding that her inaction and her intransigence caused unnecessary delay. Her refusal or reluctance to proceed with the administration of the estate amounts to a want of reasonable fidelity and a failure to carry out her duties. [24 ] The essence of the difficulty in this case is that the administration of the estate has been paralyzed by the tension between the two executrixes. This is extremely unfortunate given how little remains to be done in order to finalize and distribute the estate. [25 ] The only practical way to deal with the road block is to remove one of the executrixes. Ms. McKeen's suggestion that I should direct the executrixes to work matters out between themselves is not practical. They have been attempting, or at least Ms. Levi-Bandel has attempted, to do that for almost two years. It has not worked. Even the resignation of Ms. Guthrie and the appointment of counsel has not allowed the parties to get around the impasse. The only practical solution is to remove one of the executrixes, or appoint a new executor and trustee. The latter option does not make sense when the estate is so close to distribution. Given the support of the 12 residuary beneficiaries for the removal of Ms. McKeen, there is no reason to consider the alternative of a new trustee. [30] Other cases have applied a similar analysis. See Campbell v. Campbell , 2015 BCSC 744 at paras. 18\u201319; Re Winter Estate , 2001 NSSC 121 at para. 25; Conroy v. Stokes , [1952] 4 D.L.R. 124 (B.C.C.A.) and Re Seaton Estate , 2003 BCCA 555. [ 31 ] The main guide in exercising the Court's discretion to remove trustees is the welfare of the beneficiaries: Letterstedt at 387. It is not the interests of a particular beneficiary that are to be considered, but rather the benefit of the beneficiaries collectively: Conroy v. Stokes , at 128; Re Winter Estate , at para. 22. [ 32 ] An executor is obliged to settle the affairs of the estate and distribute to beneficiaries: Reznik v. Matty , 2013 BCSC 1346 para. 29 et seq . A power to retain an asset does not override the executor's duty to settle the affairs of the estate and to distribute. [ 33 ] Dirnberger Estate , 2016 BCSC 439, concerned an application to remove an executor who had failed to distribute a simple estate despite having had four years to do so. Kelleher J. found that unreasonable delay and failure to act can constitute grounds for removal. He noted: [11 ] There are four categories of conduct on an executor's part that will warrant removal: 1. endangerment of the trust property; 2. want of honesty; 3. want of proper capacity to execute the duties; and 4. want of reasonable fidelity. [ Conroy v. Stokes , [1952] 4 D.L.R. 124 (B.C.C.A.)] [34] Before addressing the conduct impugned by both Stephan and Ingrid, I will address a general point. Stephan relies on the conduct of Ingrid in relation to the privately held companies and the estate property. While it is true that her conduct in relation to the companies cannot be a direct reason to remove her as trustee under the Will, it is relevant to show her attitude to her siblings and her ability to carry out the duties as a trustee. Moreover, it is not possible to draw a bright line between the companies and the trust property because the companies operate businesses in the building owned by the estate. [35] There is a long list of complaints by Stephan about Ingrid's behaviour, but I will focus on the major ones that I think are determinative of this application. [36] First is Ingrid's conduct with respect to the sale and use of the View Street Property. She refused to agree to sell the property unless the other executors agreed to unreasonable conditions completely unrelated to the sale. [37] What is worse is that, acting on her behalf under a power of attorney, Mr. Reid sent several emails to the real estate agent in which he gratuitously disclosed the internal disputes between the executors and misrepresented that the other two siblings owed Ingrid money. This was nothing short than wanting to take the disputes to the brink at the risk of scuttling the prospective deal for the sale of the property. That came to fruition: the deal did not get finalised. [38] Second, although not in chronological order, Ingrid moved into the property and had the locks changed. She refused to provide keys to Edward or Stephan. She started to make modifications to the property with an apparent view to opening a new lounge. When Stephan went to visit the property on June 20, 2018 Ingrid's friend or business associate slammed the door in his face. [39] Third, there is Ingrid and Mr. Reid's conduct with respect to the mortgage and Island Savings Credit Union, which granted the mortgage. I will not detail the emails; it will suffice to state that they contained falsehoods and, once again, disclosed the internal disagreements between the parties for no good reason. What is worse is that several of the emails were an invitation to foreclose on the mortgage. Mr. Reid, an accountant, has no excuse to have sent the emails. [40] Although not in relation to the trust property, Ingrid withdrew substantial amounts of cash from the companies' bank accounts without authorisation or disclosure. [41] Mr. Reid's emails to counsel for Stephan and Edward have been rude, to the point of accusing them of lying. [42] Counsel for Ingrid says that she has not misconducted herself for the last several months, namely since the application has been filed and the application should not, therefore, be granted. I do not think that is an answer. There is every reason to think that she and her husband will resume their conduct when it suits them. [43] In my view, the matters I have set out here show all four of the types of conduct that justify removal of an executor, as set out above in the quote above from Dirnberger Estate . [44] What of the application to remove Stephan? The main (but not the only) conduct relied on in support of that was that when the listing for sale of the Montroyal home was being discussed, Stephan indicated he would not agree to its sale unless, as noted by the estate solicitor: The return of all accounting responsibilities for the estate and for the companies to a third party accounting firm (everyone has agreed on Warren Towler) and a cessation of Mr. Reid Reid's involvement in those accounting matters; The granting of a three year lease in the View Street building to Hermann's Jazz Club Inc. , which lease would include the following components\u2026 [45] I agree that Stephan's position was inappropriate. However, I also note that he resiled from that position and in fact the house was listed and sold. Unlike Ingrid and Mr. Reid's conduct, it did not put the property at risk. His conduct was nowhere near as serious as Ingrid's. Moreover, this was conduct that pre-dated the settlement agreement. Considering all of Ingrid's submissions, I do not think she has demonstrated a rationale to remove Stephan. [46] I therefore conclude that Ingrid is to be removed as executor and that Stephan and Edward are to remain as co-executors. I note that they are in agreement \u2013 as is Ingrid \u2013 that the View Street property is to be sold as soon as possible. [47] I direct that Stephan and Edward provide Ingrid with offers made on the property and their counter-offers to the same as soon as they are received. [48] Ingrid is to pass her account on a date to be agreed between counsel. [49] Stephan and Edward's special costs of this application are to be paid from the estate. \"E.M. MYERS J.\"",

Bouchard, 2021 BCCA 45 Date: 20210127 Docket: CA46788 Between: Alan Kendall carrying on business as Al\u2019s Contracting and Silver Creek Log Sort Ltd. Appellants (Plaintiffs) And Michele Bouchard carrying on business as Bouchard & Company and Michele Bouchard Inc. Respondents (Defendants) Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice Tysoe The Honourable Madam Justice Fenlon The Honourable Madam Justice Fisher On appeal from: An order of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, dated March 3, 2020 ( Kendall v. Bouchard, 2020 BCSC 727, Vancouver Docket S145569). Oral Reasons for Judgment Counsel for the Appellants, appearing via videoconference: B. Martyniuk M.B.J. Stainsby Counsel for the Respondents, appearing via videoconference: J. Forsythe Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British Columbia January 27, 2021 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia January 27, 2021 Summary: The appellants retained the respondents to provide accounting expertise to help resolve a payment dispute between the appellant and a third party. Based on the respondents\u2019 report, the appellants commenced an action against the third party. The appellants\u2019 counsel in that matter later terminated his retainer and began an action against the parties, alleging flaws in the respondents\u2019 report. The appellants subsequently brought a claim in professional negligence against the respondents. The trial judge dismissed the claim as statute-barred for having been commenced after the limitation period. The appellants challenge the trial judge\u2019s interpretation of the pre-2013 Limitation Act as only requiring knowledge of the facts that could ground a potential claim. Held: Appeal dismissed. The trial judge did not err in her interpretation and application of the Limitation Act. The limitation period begins to run when a party has the facts that, with the appropriate advice, would lead them to reasonably conclude they have a potential claim. The Act imputes the necessary technical advice once the party possesses the underlying facts. It was open to the judge to find that the appellants should have been aware that there was a problem with the respondents\u2019 report when they received their previous counsel\u2019s statement of claim. FENLON J.A. : [1] The appellants appeal the dismissal of their professional negligence claim against the respondents as statute-barred. The main issue on appeal is whether the judge erred in her interpretation and application of the postponement provisions in the pre-2013 Limitation Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 266. [2] The appellant, Mr. Kendall, and his companies, Al\u2019s Contracting and Silver Creek Log Sort Ltd., supplied logs to a sawmill. A dispute arose with the sawmill about who owed money to whom. The appellants retained Ms. Bouchard, who is a Certified Management Accountant, to review the sawmill\u2019s books and to resolve the dispute. [3] From 2000 to 2003, Ms. Bouchard spent 1,000 hours conducting a review. She concluded that the sawmill owed the appellants about $1.7 million. Based on that accounting, the appellants commenced an action against the sawmill to obtain payment. The appellants retained a lawyer, John Frank, on a contingency fee basis in June 2004 to prosecute that claim. Ms. Bouchard agreed to assist Mr. Frank in preparing the case, although she advised the appellants that an expert accountant should be retained to prepare a report, as she did not want to go to court. [4] In January 2007, Mr. Frank terminated his retainer and started an action against the appellants and the respondents, claiming that the contingency fee agreement had been breached. That action was ultimately settled, but the information in the notice of claim played an important part in the judge\u2019s analysis\u2014a matter to which I will return. [5] In 2008, the appellants retained new counsel in the action against the sawmill. Their new counsel, in turn, retained an accounting expert, Mr. Salton, who, in September 2008, identified numerous errors with Ms. Bouchard\u2019s reconstruction of the accounts. [6] The appellants commenced the underlying professional negligence action against Ms. Bouchard and her professional corporation on June 18, 2014. [7] Ms. Bouchard brought a summary trial application to dismiss the appellants\u2019 claim as statute-barred or, in the alternative, on the basis that liability had not been proven. The judge determined the matter was suitable for resolution by way of summary trial. She found the start of the running of the limitation period had been postponed until December 17, 2007, when Mr. Frank filed a statement of claim against the parties to this action, alleging flaws in Ms. Bouchard\u2019s report and her refusal to explain her work to him. Because the appellants in the present case filed the claim against Ms. Bouchard in June 2014, more than six years after receiving that information, the judge found the claim to be statute-barred and dismissed it. [8] There are two grounds of appeal: 1. Did the judge err in holding that the limitation issue was suitable for disposition by summary trial? 2. Did the judge err in interpreting and applying s. 6 of the Limitation Act ? [9] With respect to the first ground of appeal, I see no basis to conclude that the judge erred in determining that this matter was suitable for disposition by summary trial. [10] In addressing the question, she said: [29] The plaintiffs argue that there are conflicting affidavits, and in order to determine any of the matters in issue, including the limitations issue, the court will have to resolve conflicts in the sworn evidence of witnesses and ultimately make credibility findings. [30] I disagree. I fail to see any conflicting evidence with respect to the facts that I need to find in order to determine the limitations issue. In their response to the application, written argument and oral submissions, the plaintiffs pointed to no specific conflicts in the evidence at all and certainly no conflicts relating to limitation issues . [Emphasis added.] [11] On appeal, the appellants identify conflicts in the evidence as to whether Ms. Bouchard had signed a letter setting out her professional opinion on the amounts owed by the sawmill and the extent to which she participated in the subsequent litigation commenced by the appellants against that company. I do not see that these conflicts, identified for the first time on appeal, make the resolution of a limitation defence unsuitable for summary trial\u2014they are peripheral to the facts the judge relied on to decide the limitation period had expired. [12] The second ground of appeal contends the judge erred in her finding of facts and in the interpretation and application of the (admittedly) tortured language of s. 6 of the pre-2013 Limitation Act . That section provides for the postponement of the running of the six-year limitation period if certain criteria are met and reads: 6 (4) Time does not begin to run against a plaintiff or claimant with respect to an action referred to in subsection (3) until the identity of the defendant or respondent is known to the plaintiff or claimant and those facts within the plaintiff\u2019s or claimant\u2019s means of knowledge are such that a reasonable person, knowing those facts and having taken the appropriate advice a reasonable person would seek on those facts, would regard those facts as showing that (a) an action on the cause of action would, apart from the effect of the expiration of a limitation period, have a reasonable prospect of success, and (b) the person whose means of knowledge is in question ought, in the person\u2019s own interests and taking the person\u2019s circumstances into account, to be able to bring an action. (5) For the purpose of subsection (4), (a) \u201c appropriate advice\u201d , in relation to facts, means the advice of competent persons, qualified in their respective fields, to advise on the medical, legal and other aspects of the facts, as the case may require, (b) \u201cfacts\u201d include (i) the existence of a duty owed to the plaintiff or claimant by the defendant or respondent, and (ii) that a breach of a duty caused injury, damage or loss to the plaintiff or claimant, \u2026 [13] The appellants make two main arguments. First, they say the judge made an error of fact because she misapprehended the meaning of Mr. Frank\u2019s statement of claim. She found that the pleading identified Ms. Bouchard\u2019s work as faulty, when the paragraphs she relied on only say that Mr. Frank could not understand the reconstruction report. For example, at para. 27 of the statement of claim, they point to Mr. Frank saying that he \u201cwas unable to trace accounting information either back from the summary or forward from the original entries to assist in verifying these claims.\u201d [14] The appellants say the pleading does nothing more than flag Mr. Frank\u2019s inability to understand the records in order to support his allegation that the retainer letter was breached by Ms. Bouchard refusing to explain her work and answer his questions. [15] I would, with respect, not accede to this argument. Although couched in terms of Mr. Frank\u2019s inability to understand and follow Ms. Bouchard\u2019s accounting, it was open to the judge on the record before her to infer that Mr. Frank was asserting there was a problem with the report and, in particular, that there was no way to verify the sums Ms. Bouchard had concluded were owing. The problems described by Mr. Frank in his statement of claim were not new to the appellants. Mr. Frank had set out more details of his complaints about Ms. Bouchard in a letter of January 9, 2007, when he terminated his retainer, and Mr. Kendall acknowledged that Mr. Frank\u2019s complaints about not getting information were \u201calways an issue.\u201d As the judge noted, one of the primary claims against Ms. Bouchard in the underlying litigation was that she failed to assist legal counsel. [16] I also note the concerns raised by Mr. Frank in his pleading do not differ significantly from the concerns raised by Mr. Salton in his September 2008 communication, which the appellants acknowledge was sufficient to start the running of the limitation clock. [17] I turn now to the second argument raised on this ground of appeal. The appellants say that they could not have assessed whether they had a reasonable prospect of succeeding against Ms. Bouchard in professional negligence until they were told by an accountant \u2014Mr. Salton\u2014that her conclusions could not be traced back to source documents and verified. They say that did not occur until they received Mr. Salton\u2019s critical comments about Ms. Bouchard\u2019s reconstruction in September 2008, and it was therefore only at that point that the limitation period began to run. [18] In my respectful view, the appellants\u2019 argument is based on a misreading of the section. The critical point is not when a party actually receives advice from an expert that identifies the basis for a claim. It is, rather, the point at which a party has the facts that, taken with appropriate advice, would lead a reasonable person to conclude they had a reasonable prospect of a successful claim. In short, the Act imputes appropriate medical, or legal, or accounting advice to the plaintiff at the point at which they have those facts: Karsanjii Estate v. Roque (1990), 43 B.C.L.R. (2d) 234 (C.A.) at 242. [19] It follows that the judge was correct to focus on the date the appellants had the factual knowledge about Ms. Bouchard\u2019s conduct, rather than the date on which they received advice from an accounting expert, opining that her work could not be verified. In this regard, the judge said: [50] When were the critical facts within the means of knowledge of the plaintiffs? [51] I find that by the time Mr. Frank filed his statement of claim against the plaintiffs in the Frank Action, they knew or ought to have known that there were serious issues with the Reconstruction and Ms. Bouchard\u2019s accounting work more generally. The statement of claim in the Frank Action, filed December 17, 2007, raised the same concerns that form the basis of the plaintiffs\u2019 professional negligence action herein. The statement of claim makes the following allegations: 27. The Plaintiff [Mr. Frank] attempted to identify the individual transactions in the Bouchard accounting that form part of these aggregate claims to identify the underlying documentary or other evidence presumably relied on by Bouchard. With the exception of interest expense, the plaintiff unable to identify any underlying entries in the Bouchard accounting that would assist him in locating underlying evidence and verifying these claims, either in whole or in part. More particularly, the plaintiff was unable to trace accounting information either back from the summary or forward from the original entries to assist in verifying these claims. 28. In addition, the plaintiff was unable to itemize by way of a reconciliation, the difference between the balances shown as owing on Watkins records as at September 2001, the date of the Bouchard accounting, and the claims of Silver Creek and Kendall as shown on the Bouchard summary. This unaccounted for difference was approximately $200,000.00. \u2026 [53] I find that upon receipt of the statement of claim in the Frank Action, a reasonable person would have been aware that there was a problem with Ms. Bouchard\u2019s work, and that the shortcomings in her work, namely, its inability to be reconstructed or traced to source documents, meant that it likely could not be relied upon to ground a claim against Watkins in the Watkins Action. [54] The facts known to the plaintiffs or within their means of knowledge were such that, having taken the appropriate advice, they were in a position at that point to have started a claim against Ms. Bouchard and her company for the losses they suffered in pursuing what reasonably looked to be a fruitless claim in reliance on her work. [Emphasis added.] [20] I see no error in the judge\u2019s interpretation and application of the pre-2013 Limitation Act to the facts she found. Accordingly, there is no basis upon which this Court could interfere with her decision. [21] I recognize that this means that the appellants will not be able to pursue what otherwise could be a valid claim against Ms. Bouchard. It is never a satisfying outcome for a plaintiff to find their claim barred by the passage of time. But limitation acts seek to balance rationales oriented towards defendants\u2014the right to be free of suits at some point and to have cases brought diligently when evidence is fresh\u2014with the interests of plaintiffs to have a reasonable period within which to commence an action once they know enough to reasonably do so: Novak v. Bond, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 808 at para. 66. In this case, that balance results in the appellants\u2019 action being barred. I acknowledge that is a frustrating result for the appellants, but it is compelled by the balance the Legislature has struck and the law we must apply. [22] The appeal should be dismissed. [23] TYSOE J.A. : I agree. [24] FISHER J.A. : I agree. [25] TYSOE J.A. : The appeal is dismissed. \u201cThe Honourable Madam Justice Fenlon\u201d",

        "text": "COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA Citation: Kaban Resources Inc. v. Goldcorp Inc., 2021 BCCA 6 Date: 20210108 Docket: CA47032 Between: Kaban Resources Inc. Appellant (Plaintiff) And Goldcorp Inc., Goldcorp Holdings (Barbados) Ltd., and Guatemala Holdings (Barbados) Limited Respondent (Defendants) Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice Grauer (In Chambers) On appeal from: An order of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, dated September 4, 2020 ( Kaban Resources Inc. v. Goldcorp Inc. , 2020 BCSC 1307, Vancouver Docket S165822). Counsel for the Appellant (via videoconference): R.D. Gibbens, Q.C. Counsel for the Respondents (via videoconference): A. Cocks Place and Date of Hearing: Vancouver, British Columbia December 21, 2020 Place and Date of Judgment: Vancouver, British Columbia January 8, 2021 Summary: The respondents apply for security for costs of the appeal and the proceedings below in the respective amounts of $16,017.95 and $163,851.14. The respondents seek an order that the appeal be stayed pending the posting of security for costs and that the respondents be at liberty to apply to have the appeal dismissed as abandoned should the appellants fail to post security. Trial costs is this matter have not yet been assessed. Held: the applications for security for costs of the appeal and trial are allowed, but not in the amount sought by the respondents. Security for costs of the appeal are ordered in the amount of $11,200. The appellant led no evidence that would demonstrate that an order for security for costs would prevent it from pursuing this appeal, and failed to meet its onus of demonstrating that it would not be in the interests of justice to order security for costs of the appeal. Security for costs of the trial are also ordered, but in the amount of $60,000. The manner in which the appellant pursued its claim in the proceedings below caused the respondent to obtain and deliver a costly expert report on the question of damages. Now, the parties cannot proceed to assess trial costs without waiving privilege over the expert report, practically preventing the respondents from pursuing its remedies from trial. As such, the respondents have established real prejudice and met the onus of demonstrating that it is in the interests of justice to order partial security for costs of the trial. The appeal is stayed for 30 days to permit the appellants time to post the security. In the event the appellants fail to post the security ordered, the respondents are at liberty to apply to have the appeal dismissed as abandoned. Reasons for Judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice Grauer: [1] The appellant, Kaban Resources Inc, has brought this appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice Voith, then of the Supreme Court, dismissing its claim after a summary trial. Justice Voith\u2019s reasons for judgment are indexed at 2020 BCSC 1307. [2] The respondents, whom I shall describe collectively as \u201cGoldcorp\u201d, now apply under sections 24(1) and 10(2)(a) and (b) of the Court of Appeal Act , RSBC 1996, c 77, for an order requiring the appellant to post security both for the costs of the appeal, and for their costs of the proceedings below. Goldcorp seeks security in the amount of $16,017.95 for a one-day appeal, and in the amount of $163,851.14 for its trial costs (in excess of existing security), and asks that the appeal be stayed pending deposit of the amounts sought. Goldcorp also seeks the costs of this application payable forthwith. [3] The appellant\u2019s claim against Goldcorp was for damages for the wrongful repudiation of a contract between the parties. To summarize matters very briefly, the parties had signed a letter agreement on February 3, 2016, providing for the transfer of mining assets of Goldcorp in Guatemala on various terms and conditions. On March 14, 2016, the appellant delivered an agreement to Goldcorp that purported to comply with the terms and conditions of the letter agreement, but involved a new party, Fortuna Silver Mines Inc., not mentioned in the letter agreement. Goldcorp had something to say about this, responding by letter on March 17, 2016. On March 21, 2016, Kaban sent an email to Goldcorp asserting that the March 17 letter constituted a repudiation of the February 3 letter agreement, and advising that Kaban accepted the repudiation, and considered the letter agreement to be at an end. [4] As I will discuss in more detail below, at a relatively early stage in the Supreme Court proceedings, the appellant was ordered to post security for costs in the amount of $60,000. It did so. The matter was later set for trial by jury, and ultimately came before Justice Voith on Goldcorp\u2019s summary trial application. [5] As Justice Voith noted at para 5, the application raised four issues: i. Is this application suitable for disposition under Rule 9-7? ii. Did the Letter Agreement contain various implied terms? iii. Was there any obligation on Goldcorp to consent to the Fortuna Agreement? and iv. Did the March 17 Letter constitute a repudiation of the Letter Agreement? [6] The parties were agreed as to the first issue: the application was suitable for disposition by way of summary trial. As to the rest, Justice Voith noted at para 6 that each issue was independent. Goldcorp would succeed if the answer to question (ii) were \u2018yes\u2019, or if the answer to either of questions (iii) or (iv) were \u2018no\u2019. The judge concluded that the answer to (ii) was \u2018yes\u2019, the answer to (iii) was \u2018no\u2019, and it was unnecessary to answer question (iv). [7] Accordingly, the judge dismissed the appellant\u2019s claim with costs. Goldcorp subsequently applied for double costs under Rule 9-1(5)(b) of the Supreme Court Civil Rules . That application was dismissed in reasons delivered December 15, 2020, and indexed as 2020 BCSC 1982. [8] I turn next to consider Goldcorp\u2019s application for security for the costs of this appeal. I will then consider its application for security for its trial costs. [9] The relevant considerations have been discussed in many cases. I will quote from one, the reasons of Madam Justice D. Smith (in Chambers) in Arbutus Bay Estates Ltd v Canada (Attorney General) , 2017 BCCA 133: [17] The appellant against whom security is sought bears the onus of showing why security should not be required: Creative Salmon Company Ltd. v. Staniford , 2007 BCCA 285 at para. 9. The ultimate question is whether the order would be in the interests of justice: Lu v. Mao , 2006 BCCA 560 at para. 6. The following relevant considerations were set out in Lu at para. 6: (a) the appellant\u2019s financial means; (b) the merits of the appeal; (c) the timeliness of the application; and (d) whether the costs will be readily recoverable. [18] The appellant\u2019s financial position is the principal basis on which an order for some, all, or none of the security for appeal costs is made. See Zen v. M.R.S. Trust Company (1997), 88 B.C.A.C. 198 at para. 18. It is a discretionary order. Courts have also distinguished between corporate and individual plaintiffs, generally treating corporate plaintiffs with less flexibility. [10] As Justice Smith observed, the onus is on the appellant to establish that the interests of justice require that security not be ordered. [11] There is no doubt that Goldcorp has brought this application in a timely manner. Accordingly, the question really comes down to the appellant\u2019s financial position and the merits of its appeal. These need to be balanced in order to ensure that the interests of justice are not frustrated by an order for security of costs inhibiting a meritorious appeal. [12] In this case, it is relevant to note that the appellant is a shell company with no active business. If it has any exigible assets, or other means of securing costs, it has declined to adduce any evidence of such, though repeatedly invited to do so by Goldcorp in order to avoid this application. It has been able to raise funds, including $60,000 to post in the court below to secure Goldcorp\u2019s costs there, but that is quite a different thing from having the ability to satisfy a judgment of costs against it. No one connected with the appellant has come forward to undertake to cover costs. [13] In essence, the appellant rests its opposition to the application on what it maintains is a meritorious appeal. It has not, however, led evidence to indicate that if it is obliged to post security for the costs of the appeal, it will be unable to proceed. [14] I am satisfied that the appellant should be ordered to post security for Goldcorp\u2019s costs of this appeal. The appellant has failed to meet the onus upon it of demonstrating that it would not be in the interests of justice to make the order. [15] With respect to the merits of the appeal, I would not suggest that the appeal is bound to fail. Nevertheless, the grounds it raises attract, prima facie , a deferential standard. Though they are framed as errors of law, they raise questions of contractual interpretation. But even if properly described as errors of law, the appellant is obliged to charge uphill given the trial judge\u2019s findings. An additional ground of appeal, alleging that the judge created \u201ca reasonable apprehension of bias through \u2026 engaging in ad hoc judicial moralism\u201d also faces the significant hurdle of a heavy burden, given the presumptions of impartiality and judicial integrity. [16] The question then becomes, how much should the appellant be obliged to post as security for Goldcorp\u2019s costs of the one-day appeal? Goldcorp\u2019s draft bill of costs seeks the maximum for the items relating to the preparation of the factum and preparation for the hearing of the appeal. Given the nature of the appeal, I consider that unlikely to be achieved on an assessment. Its expected disbursements include the sum of $2,850 for transcripts, which will be disputed in the context of a summary trial, where the evidence was all in affidavits. In the circumstances, I would consider $8,000 for costs and applicable taxes, and $3,200 for disbursements and taxes, to be a fair estimate for present purposes. Accordingly, I order the appellant to post $11,200 to secure Goldcorp\u2019s costs of this appeal. [17] As Justice Smith observed in the Arbutus Bay Estates case at para 16, the principles relating to an application for security for the costs of trial differ from those relating to security for the costs of the appeal. Most importantly, the onus flips from the appellant to the respondent. In para 19, Justice Smith said this: [19] The principles governing the exercise of discretion in awarding security for trial costs are set out in Fat Mel\u2019s Restaurant Ltd. v. Canadian Northern Shield Insurance Company (1993), 76 B.C.L.R. (2d) 231 (C.A.); and Kropp v. Swanaset Bay Golf Course Ltd. (1997), 29 B.C.L.R. (3d) 252 (C.A). They include: (a) The onus is on the applicant to show that it is in the interest of justice to order posting for security of trial costs; (b) The applicant must show prejudice if the order is not made; and (c) In determining the interests of justice the chambers judge should consider the merits of the appeal and the effect of such an order on the ability of the appellant to continue the appeal. See Bronson v. Hewitt, 2012 BCCA 268 at para. 13. [18] A relevant consideration is the fact that, generally, in relation to collecting its trial costs, the respondent will be in no worse a position by reason of the appeal than it was before the appeal. It follows that an important question is whether the appellant\u2019s pursuit of the appeal negatively alters Goldcorp\u2019s ability to recover sums found by the trial court to be owing to it (for instance, by the appellant obtaining a stay pending appeal): see, for instance, D Bacon Holdings Ltd v Naramata Vines Inc , 2010 BCCA 427 at paras 25\u201326; Agent E v Canada (Attorney General) , 2018 BCCA 492 at para 17; and EB v British Columbia (Child, Family and Community Services) , 2020 BCCA 263 at para 29. [19] The appellant contends that Goldcorp has demonstrated no such negative effect here, and indeed already has the benefit of security for its trial costs in the amount of $60,000. Moreover, the appellant points out, Goldcorp has yet to have its trial costs assessed, a step that is usually expected unless the interests of justice dictate otherwise: Arbutus Bay Estates at para 20. [20] Goldcorp maintains that it has demonstrated a negative effect, and real prejudice. I agree. The question is whether it is sufficient to support the amount of security it requests. [21] Goldcorp points to the manner in which the appellant pursued its claim below. Initially, it indicated that it would pursue matters in an economical manner. When Goldcorp raised the prospect of an application for security for costs, the appellant sought to sever the questions of liability and quantum. It was in this context that it was ordered to pay security in the amount of $60,000. [22] But, as Goldcorp notes, that is not what happened. Instead, the appellant set the matter down for a six-week jury trial on both liability and quantum, set for the fall of 2020. Although Goldcorp set its summary trial application down for hearing in August 2020, it was obliged, it asserts, to obtain and deliver a lengthy expert report on the question of damages, given the pending jury trial. [23] The expense related to this expert report comes to a total of just over $168,000. This cost was not in contemplation at the time Goldcorp applied for security for its trial costs, because the trial was then expected to be on liability alone. [24] Now, because of this appeal, Goldcorp is not in a position to disclose its expert file for the purposes of supporting this expense, because to do so would waive privilege when the appellant seeks to have the case returned to the Supreme Court for a trial on damages\u2014the subject of the expert report. [25] In these circumstances, I agree that prejudice arises. Because of the appellant\u2019s change in tactics (which I do not criticize, but which has consequences), Goldcorp has incurred a hefty expense that was not anticipated when it first sought to secure its costs. Now, because of the appeal, it cannot proceed to assess those costs without waiving privilege. The practical effect is much like a stay, since the respondent is practically prevented from pursuing its remedies in the trial court, all in the context of an appellant who appears to be costs-proof (compare Chung v Shin , 2017 BCCA 355 at paras 33\u201335). [26] But the fact remains that the appropriateness of the expert witness fee, and the reasonableness of incurring it at the time it was incurred, are in issue. It is by far the largest component of Goldcorp\u2019s unassessed bill of costs for the proceeding below. [27] It is, of course, open to me to order full security as requested, partial security or no security at all. Given all of the factors I have discussed, I consider that it is in the interests of justice to require the appellant to post an additional amount to secure Goldcorp\u2019s trial costs\u2014but not the full amount requested by Goldcorp, particularly without an assessment. I conclude that requiring the appellant to post the further sum of $60,000 would be appropriate. [28] Within 30 days, the appellant shall post the sum of $11,200 as security for Goldcorp\u2019s costs of this appeal. [29] Within 30 days, the appellant shall post the sum of $60,000 as further security for Goldcorp\u2019s costs of the proceedings in the Supreme Court. [30] The appeal is stayed pending the posting of security as ordered. [31] Goldcorp will be at liberty to apply to have the appeal dismissed as abandoned in the event the appellant fails to comply with this order. [32] Goldcorp seeks the costs of this application payable forthwith, in any event of the cause. In the circumstances, given that the appeal may continue, I award Goldcorp the costs of this application in the cause. I note, moreover, that Goldcorp\u2019s draft bill of costs already includes the costs of preparation for and attendance at this application. In the circumstances, an order requiring the appellant to pay Goldcorp the costs of this application forthwith in any event of the cause, as Goldcorp requests, would be equivalent to requiring the appellant to pay the application costs twice: once forthwith, and a second time when posting the security that has now been ordered. \u201cThe Honourable Mr. Justice Grauer\u201d",

        "text": "IN THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA Citation: Jeet v. Lata, 2019 BCSC 26 Date: 20190109 Docket: E53511 Registry: New Westminster Between: Umesh Jeet Claimant And: Roshini Lata Respondent Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice G.C. Weatherill Oral Reasons for Judgment The Claimant appearing in person: U. Jeet Counsel for the Respondent: J. Tchezganova Place and Dates of Trial: New Westminster, B.C. January 7\u20138, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: New Westminster, B.C. January 9, 2019 [1] After opening skirmishes at the commencement of the trial, the parties to this family dispute settled all of the issues between them except the respondent\u2019s entitlement to spousal support. The trial proceeded on that issue. [2] The claimant and the respondent are currently 59 and 53 years of age respectively. They were married on November 10, 1981 in Fiji at the ages of 22 and 16 respectively. It was what is commonly referred to as an \u201carranged marriage\u201d. They separated just short of 32 years later on October 22, 2013. [3] The claimant has a Grade 10 education. The respondent has a Grade 11 education. She emigrated with him from Fiji to Canada in 1982 shortly after they were married. They had their first child when the respondent was 17 and their second when she was 22. The two children of their relationship are now 35 and 30, are living independently, and are no longer children of the marriage as defined by the Divorce Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. 3 (2nd Supp.). [4] Until the children became self-sufficient, the respondent was their primary caregiver as was customary in the parties\u2019 culture. The respondent also worked full-time at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Vancouver (\u201cHyatt\u201d), initially as a housekeeper from 1988 to 2003, and from 2003 to the present as a switchboard operator. As is also the parties\u2019 custom, the respondent was the primary homemaker during their relationship. She prepared the family\u2019s meals and did the household cleaning, albeit with occasional assistance from the claimant\u2019s mother. The respondent also took care of the claimant\u2019s mother when she was ill. [5] The claimant has been employed full-time during the daytime as a janitor by the Willingdon Church for the past 25 years. In addition to that employment, for the past ten years, he has also been employed during the evenings as a janitor by the Langley Golf Course. He is paid on a combined basis of an 80-hour-work week. [6] During the course of the parties\u2019 relationship and in addition to his two full time jobs, the claimant started a cleaning business through a corporate entity called Leading Edge Maintenance Inc. (\u201cLeading Edge\u201d). The claimant was the sole shareholder of the company. It provided cleaning services by way of contracts with various clients, including the Surrey Memorial Hospital. The cleaning services provided by Leading Edge were performed by the claimant and the respondent, although others were occasionally employed to assist with the work. The claimant testified that most of Leading Edge\u2019s contracts were lost as a result of the stress he was under after the parties separated. However, he continued to work in his full-time jobs at Willingdon Church and Langley Golf Course. [7] The respondent testified that, in 2006, she was offered an opportunity to become a housekeeping supervisor at Hyatt but that taking the job would have resulted in her becoming the supervisor of the claimant\u2019s parents who also worked there. After discussing the opportunity with the claimant, she decided that it would be better for the family if she did not accept the job. [8] In 2014, after separating from the claimant, the respondent was offered the position of \u201cmanager on duty\u201d at Hyatt. She turned down the job because she was suffering from high stress and anxiety as a result of the parties\u2019 separation. [9] The respondent testified that, throughout the parties\u2019 relationship, the claimant made the parties\u2019 mortgage payments but she paid all other household expenses, including utilities, food, phones, and car payments. The parties owned and occupied a home in Surrey, British Columbia at the time of their separation (\u201cmatrimonial home\u201d). The matrimonial home has a coach house as well as a basement suite that the parties rented to tenants for $800 per month and $700 per month respectively. [10] After separation, the claimant continued to occupy the matrimonial home. He testified that the rental income has been intermittent since their separation as a result of various legal issues he encountered with the Municipality of Surrey as well as repairs that were necessary to the rental suites. In addition to rental of the coach house and basement suite, the claimant has rented out an upstairs bedroom for $400 per month. [11] The claimant testified that all of the parties\u2019 income, including the rental income, was pooled by them and used for living expenses. The respondent testified that much of the money was kept by the claimant and that she is unaware of how he used it. [12] Since leaving the matrimonial home in October 2013, the respondent has lived in furnished rental accommodation in White Rock, BC. Her rent is $800 per month. She testified that her standard of living has declined since the separation. She no longer has the \u201cluxury\u201d of living in her own home and cannot afford to do many of the things that she was able to do when she was living with the claimant, such as attending movies and regularly going to restaurants. [13] The respondent testified that, at the time of separation, she had personal debt of $5,000 but now she has debt of approximately $37,000 because she is unable to make ends meet. She conceded that some of her current debt was incurred for legal fees in respect of this proceeding but she did not say how much. [14] Since separation, the respondent has received only $1,600 from the claimant in spousal support, although he also made car payments on her behalf in the amount of $400 per month for the period from March 1, 2018 to August 1, 2018. Accordingly, she has received a total of $4,000 in spousal support from the claimant. [15] The parties\u2019 respective Line 150 income since separation was as follows: Claimant Respondent 2014 $69,926 $41,079 2015 $73,530 $42,074 2016 $74,142 $47,129 2017 $74,994 $46,952 [16] On questioning by the Court, the claimant stated that he expected his Line 150 income for 2018 to be approximately the same as it was in 2017. [17] In addition to his employment income, the claimant disclosed the following income in his Form F8 Financial Statements sworn December 18, 2017 and December 10, 2018: Rental Income Cleaning Contracts Total 2017 $11,700 $4,000 $15,700 2018 $12,600 $12,300 $24,900 [18] During the period from May 19, 2017 to August 7, 2018, the claimant made payments to his Visa credit card totalling $59,127, which averages almost $4,000 per month. He could not explain where this money had come from. He did not produce his bank account records despite them having been requested by counsel for the respondent. [19] The claimant is under the care of a cardiologist and, for at least the past year, he has been advised by his family doctor not to work more than 40 hours per week due to various medical symptoms which include hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea and a cardiac condition. However, he had not heeded that advice and has continued to work at both of his jobs. [20] The claimant testified that, approximately three weeks ago, he suffered a lower back injury and has been unable to work since. He has filed a claim with the WorkSafeBC and has been told to take one month off work. [21] During his direct examination, the claimant provided the evidence necessary to establish his entitlement to a divorce. That evidence was unchallenged and his claim for a divorce is unopposed. [22] Accordingly, I am granting an order of divorce to be effective 31 days after the date of these reasons for judgment, subject only to an appeal of this divorce order being filed in the interim, in which case the divorce will be subject to the outcome of the appeal. [23] The sole issue for determination is whether the respondent is entitled to spousal support and, if so, in what amount. [24] Section 161 of the Family Law Act , S.B.C. 2011, c. 25 [ FLA ] provides as follows: 161. In determining entitlement to spousal support\u2026the court must consider the following objectives: (a) to recognize any economic advantages or disadvantages to the spouses arising from the relationship between the spouses or the breakdown of that relationship; (b) to apportion between the spouses any financial consequences arising from the care of their child, beyond the duty to provide support for the child; (c) to relieve any economic hardship of the spouses arising from the breakdown of the relationship between the spouses; (d) as far as practicable, to promote the economic self-sufficiency of each spouse within a reasonable period of time. [25] Section 162 of the FLA provides that the amount and duration of spousal support, if any, must be determined on consideration of the conditions, means, needs and other circumstances of each spouse, including the length of time the spouses lived together and the functions performed by each spouse during the period they lived together. [26] Similar provisions are contained in ss. 15.2(4) and (6) of the Divorce Act. [27] The respondent seeks both retroactive and ongoing spousal support on a compensatory (economic disadvantage) and non-compensatory (needs) basis. Compensatory support relates primarily to the first two objectives of spousal support referred to in s. 161 of the FLA , while non-compensatory support primarily relates to the third and fourth objectives. [28] The respondent has failed to demonstrate that she suffered an economic disadvantage arising from the parties\u2019 relationship or the breakdown of that relationship. The Court was left to speculate that her decision to turn down the housekeeping supervisor and manager on duty positions would have resulted in an economic advantage to her. No evidence was presented regarding her management qualifications or aptitude for either position, the hours she would have had to work, the pay she would have received, or the likelihood that she would have succeeded in the position. More was needed to be shown than merely that the positions were offered to her. [29] Moreover, the evidence is that both parties contributed financially to their relationship throughout their marriage. They both made sacrifices\u2014the claimant in the form of working additional jobs and the respondent in the form of child care, household chores, and assisting the claimant in his cleaning jobs. No attempt was made by the respondent to show that she contributed a greater amount than did the claimant. No attempt was made by the respondent to show that she was economically disadvantaged by being the primary caregiver to the children. Indeed, the evidence is to the contrary. She continued to work full-time in her career at Hyatt. [30] In summary, the evidence is insufficient to support the respondent\u2019s claim for compensatory spousal support. [31] In Chutter v. Chutter , 2008 BCCA 507, the Court of Appeal described non\u2011compensable spousal support in the following terms at paras. 54 and 55: [54] Where compensatory principles do not apply, need alone may be sufficient to ground a claim for spousal support\u2026 Non-compensatory support is grounded in the \u201csocial obligation model\u201d of marriage, in which marriage is seen as an interdependent union. It embraces the idea that upon dissolution of a marriage, the primary burden of meeting the needs of the disadvantaged spouse falls on his or her former partner, rather than the state\u2026 Non-compensatory support aims to narrow the gap between the needs and means of the spouses upon marital breakdown, and as such, it is often referred to as the \u201cmeans and needs\u201d approach to spousal support. \u2026 [55] The concept of \u201cneeds\u201d in the context of non-compensatory spousal support goes beyond basic necessities of life and varies according to the circumstances of the parties. As stated by Finch J.A. (as he then was) in Myers v. Myers (1995), 17 R.F.L. (4 th ) 298, 65 B.C.A.C. 226, at para. 10: \u201cNeed\u201d or \u201cneeds\u201d are not absolute quantities. They may vary according to the circumstances of the parties and the family unit as a whole. \u201cNeed\u201d does not end when the spouse seeking support achieves a subsistence level of income or any level of income above subsistence. \u201cNeeds\u201d is a flexible concept and is one of several considerations which a trial judge must take into account in deciding whether any order for spousal support is warranted. [32] In V.B v. M.B. , 2017 BCSC 1761, this Court stated at paras. 240 to 242: [240] The goal of needs-based spousal support is to narrow the gap between the needs and means of former spouses. As explained in Chutter v. Chutter , 2008 BCCA 507, in longer marriages, the courts have measured need against the marital standard of living by looking at the difference between the spouses\u2019 post-separation standard of living: see paras. 58-59. See also Hodgkinson v. Hodgkinson , 2006 BCCA 158 at paras. 68-69. [241] In Lee v. Lee , 2014 BCCA 383, the Court of Appeal upheld a trial judge\u2019s dismissal of a husband\u2019s claim for non-compensatory spousal support based on the disparity in the parties\u2019 post-separation incomes. In that case, the husband claimed an income of less than $20,000 compared to his wife\u2019s income of $120,000. [242] In her majority reasons, Justice Newbury carefully examined the cases dealing with non-compensatory support. At para. 65, Justice Newbury wrote: \u2026 To rule as a matter of law that Mr. Lee should be compensated indefinitely for the \u201closs\u201d of the ability to share in Ms. Lee\u2019s income and lifestyle would, taken to its logical conclusion, mean that support must be ordered on one model or the other in virtually every case that comes before the court. The concept of need (in the true sense) of the applicant spouse would be supplanted by the sole criterion of the respondent spouse\u2019s ability to pay. Marriage would , contrary to what was said in Moge , automatically entitle a spouse to the standard of living enjoyed during the marriage, or as much as the payor could afford. I respectfully agree with Professor Rogerson\u2019s suggestion, and with the Court in Griffiths, supra , that this cannot be correct. A \u2018clean break\u2019 is clearly possible in this case, and again as stated in Moge , the mere fact of marriage or its breakdown does not activate a \u201cgeneral tool of redistribution.\u201d As far as I am aware, this principle has not been overruled. [33] It is clear from the foregoing case law that mere disparity of post-separation income is insufficient to establish a right to non-compensatory spousal support. [34] This was a long-term marriage of 32 years. The standard of living the parties enjoyed during their relationship was a result of their combined incomes. While together, they worked in their separate jobs as well as together in the cleaning business. They were able to live within their means. [35] However, after separation, while the claimant has continued to support his pre-separation lifestyle, the respondent has been unable to. I am satisfied on the evidence that she is barely eking out a living despite her minimal expenses and that she struggles to make ends meet. [36] Having considered these cases and the parties\u2019 post-separation lifestyles, I have concluded that this is an appropriate case to award the respondent non-compensatory spousal support based upon need and to relieve the economic hardship arising from the breakdown of the marriage. I have also concluded that a lump sum award is appropriate in this case. It will allow the parties to make a clean break from each other and will promote the economic self-sufficiency of both of them. [37] In my view, given the length of the parties\u2019 marriage, the functions that each party performed during their marriage and the agreement that the claimant will purchase the respondent\u2019s equity interest in the matrimonial home for $240,000, the respondent\u2019s needs will be met by an award at the low end of the scale under the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines . I have taken into account the parties\u2019 respective incomes since separation, including the undeclared rental and cleaning contract income of the claimant. I have also taken into account the $4,000 the respondent has already received in spousal support. I have considered, as well, the claimant\u2019s health issues and that he will unlikely be able to maintain the feverish work pace that he has engaged in over the previous years. [38] Pursuant to s. 170(c) of the FLA and s. 15.2(1) of the Divorce Act , I am ordering that the claimant pay to the respondent a lump sum amount of $40,000 in respect of retroactive and prospective spousal support. [39] Given that most of the issues raised by the parties were settled at the opening of the trial and that the amount awarded for the final issue, spousal support, is substantially less than what was sought by respondent\u2019s counsel during her submissions, it is my view that an award of costs is not appropriate in this case. \u201cG.C.

        "text": "IN THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA Citation: Green v. Canada (Public Prosecution Service), 2019 BCSC 46 Date: 20190116 Docket: S101091 Registry: Victoria Between: Ian Earl Green Plaintiff And: Public Prosecution Service of Canada, Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General, Province of British Columbia, Vancouver Police Department, Victoria Police Department, Regina Defendants Corrected Judgment: Counsel\u2019s information on page 2 of the judgment was corrected on February 8, 2019 Before: The Honourable Justice Young Reasons for Judgment The Plaintiff Appearing in Person: I. E. Green Counsel for the Public Prosecution Service of Canada and the Department of Justice, British Columbia Region: S. M. Repas Counsel for the Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General, Province of British Columbia and Regina: L. F. de Lima Counsel for the City of Vancouver: K.F.W. Liang Counsel for the City of Victoria: R. Macquisten Place and Date of Trial/Hearing: Victoria, B.C. January 8, 2019 Place and Date of Judgment: Victoria, B.C. January 16, 2019 [1] The Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General for the Province of British Columbia and Regina (collectively the \u201cProvince\u201d) apply to court to have this action dismissed against the Province for want of prosecution pursuant to Rule 22-7(7) of the Supreme Court Civil Rules. Alternatively, the Province seeks a summary trial on the issue of the expiration of the limitation period to be heard independently from other issues in the action pursuant to Rule 5-3(1)(p) and 12-5(67) and for an order that the action be dismissed against the Province pursuant to Rule 9-7 of the Rules. [2] The Public Prosecution Service of Canada as represented by the Attorney General of Canada (collectively \u201cCanada\u201d) seeks the same orders. [3] Counsel for the City of Vancouver and for the City of Victoria appear as interested parties seeking to have the action dismissed against all parties. [4] Mr. Green was served with these applications and did file affidavits in response. I have checked the court registry and his response was not filed. Mr. Green was declared a vexatious litigant earlier this year and must obtain leave to file documents in court. He applied by requisition to file numerous documents in the previous few months and his requests have been denied. The documents he sought to file do not remain on the file. It is possible that one of the documents was his response to this application. Nonetheless, he was able to file and serve his affidavits and he relied on them in his oral submissions in court. Accordingly, I allowed the application to proceed. [5] This action was commenced by Mr. Green on March 18, 2010. His complaints arise from charges against him from February 12, 2004 for possession and trafficking of a controlled substance and from his arrest in March 2006 and subsequent incarceration. He complains that he was mistreated by being housed in the same cell as a person known to be a sex offender. As a result he was falsely accused (presumably by other inmates) of being a sex offender himself. Presumably his claim is against the Province for breach of a duty of care it owed to him. [6] He complains that while in custody he was subjected to repeated abusive acts by recurrent awakening while he was attempting to sleep. I assume that he is alleging that guards kept waking him. He claims that he was robbed of his medication but does not say by whom. He was refused a vegan meal. He was kept in segregation. He accused the defendants of \u201cdouble bunking\u201d segregated prisoners. While he was incarcerated, he alleges that the prison guards were slow to provide him with his medication. On August 9, 2006 he and another prisoner were removed from segregation and placed in general population. He alleges that this demonstrated moral turpitude and malice. [7] I am using Mr. Green\u2019s language because it is difficult to paraphrase it as it is not clear to me what legal cause of action he is alleging. [8] Mr. Green claims to have been assaulted viciously in contravention with the Criminal Code by David Paul Graham on September 13, 2006. He does not identify who David Paul Graham is in his pleading. [9] He claims he was not provided medical treatment and was left to suffer. I assume that is by the prison guards, but it is not clear that this happened in jail. [10] The plaintiff claims that he now endures the social stigma of a (falsely accused) sex offender leaving him a social pariah. He suffers headaches from injuries from assaults caused to him in prison and he is now homeless. He suffers a long-term psychiatric disorder due to the stress of being misidentified as a sex offender. [11] On or about February 25, 2010, a female resident who resided below the plaintiff allegedly called the plaintiff a \u201cskinner\u201d. On or about December 3, 2010, an unknown female allegedly publicly identified him as having been in a psychiatric hospital. [12] This is not an application to strike pleadings. Such an application would likely succeed. This is an application to strike for want of prosecution. In short, Mr. Green has not prosecuted this claim for 8 years. [13] When asked why he did not take steps in his lawsuit, the plaintiff described other lawsuits which were either unrelated or peripherally related to this lawsuit. He advised the court that he is homeless and that he had his computer stolen which makes it difficult for him to do his legal research and prepare his legal documents. [14] The writ of summons was filed on March 18, 2010. The Province filed an appearance on March 22, 2010. The Province filed a statement defence on April 8, 2010. The Province stated in its statement of defence that it had not been properly named as the Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, Province of British Columbia and Regina are not legal entities and cannot be sued. The Province pleaded s. 7 of the Crown Proceeding Act , RSBC 1996, c. 89. [15] The Province also pleaded the Limitation Act , SBC 2012, c. 13 and that the plaintiff\u2019s claim was barred by the expiration of time. [16] On April 14, 2010, Canada filed an appearance and on April 21, 2010, Canada filed a statement of defence. In Canada\u2019s statement of defence, Canada pleaded that the wrong party had been sued. The Public Prosecution Service of Canada and Regina are not legal entities. Canada relied on s. 23 of the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act, RSC 1985, c. C-50. Canada pleaded that the plaintiff\u2019s claims were barred by the expiration of time pursuant to the Limitation Act . Canada denied any mistreatment of the plaintiff while he was in jail. Both Canada and the Province denied disseminating any information maligning the plaintiff\u2019s character. [17] On March 20, 2018, eight years after filing the writ of summons and statement of claim, the plaintiff applied to reopen the case and sought an order renewing his indigent status. He was granted indigent status. He did not file a notice of intention to proceed. No further steps were taken in this action. [18] As an aside, the plaintiff had commenced several other actions which have been dismissed over the past three years. On February 9, 2018, Mr. Justice MacKenzie declared that Mr. Green was a vexatious litigant. Mr. Green appealed that decision, but failed to file material in time and the appeal did not proceed. [19] The test for dismissal for want of prosecution is set out in Irving v. Irving , [1982] B.C.J. No. 970 (C.A.) approved of in PMC Builders and Developers Ltd. v. Country West Construction Ltd ., 2009 BCCA 535. The applicant must satisfy the court that there has been: (1) inordinate delay; (2) inordinate delay is inexcusable; (3) inordinate delay has caused or is likely to cause some serious prejudice to the applicant in that the applicant will be denied fair trial; and (4) on a balance of justice between the parties action should be dismissed; [20] The Province and Canada submit that, where a case involves serious allegations against the credit and character of a defendant, there is a higher onus to pursue relief diligently. The plaintiff has accused the Province and Canada of torturing him, demonstrating malice and moral turpitude, intentionally breaching regulations of the Correction Act of British Columbia, fabricating evidence and conspiring to smear him. These are serious allegations. [21] I am to look at the overall delay. The incidents giving rise to the allegations arose in 2006, some 12 to 13 years ago. From the start of the proceeding, there was an eight-year gap before any action was taken. The only action that was taken was to apply for indigent status. No further positive steps were taken in the litigation. [22] I find that the delay is inexcusable. I reviewed the affidavits of Mr. Green and I gave him every opportunity during the hearing to tell me why he had done nothing for eight years in this litigation. All he could do is recite what occurred in other cases or the fact that his rights were being challenged. He is certainly passionate about the law and about the Charter , but he was unable to answer my questions directly. The only evidence which has any remote relevance to the question is the fact that his computer was stolen and he is homeless. [23] I accept that those two factors would cause delay; however, I cannot accept the fact that those two factors caused eight years of delay. During that time the plaintiff was pursuing other litigation despite his homelessness. Had he intended to proceed with this litigation, he could have used public library services or even handwritten documents and filed them. He has handwritten some requisitions in the past. I asked if he was busy with other litigation, but he did not present that as an explanation for delay. My conclusion is there is no evidence of a reasonable excuse for an eight-year delay. [24] The allegations made against Canada and the Province are against prison employees who may not still be employees and who have not been identified by Mr. Green. The events complained of occurred between 11 and 14 years ago. It is highly unlikely witnesses would recall any of the events if they occurred. [25] I have found the delay inordinate and inexcusable and as a result a rebuttable presumption of prejudice arises: Busse v. Robinson Morelli Chertkow , 1999 BCCA 313 (\u201cBusse\u201d) at para. 18. Mr. Green has not rebutted the presumption of prejudice. [26] In the end, I am to balance the justice between the parties. Certainly dismissing his action will prejudice the plaintiff; however, I am mindful of the fact that most of the allegations he raises appear to be allegations of negligence for events which occurred in 2006 primarily. He waited for four years to bring the action and so it is highly likely that his claims of negligence were statute-barred. There are some allegations against individual females arising in 2010, but they are not alleging any cause of action known in law. The females are not identified. The allegations against some are calling Mr. Green a \u201cskinner\u201d and calling Mr. Green someone who has been in a psychiatric institute. Neither of these claims could succeed as currently pleaded. This litigation appears to have little chance of success and should be dismissed. [27] As a result of my findings, it is not necessary for me to consider the summary trial or severance of the issues of liability and damages. [28] The City of Vancouver and the City of Victoria appeared as interested parties because the police departments in those cities have been named as litigants. The City of Vancouver is not on the record because the named defendant Vancouver Police Department is not a legal entity. Police forces are not legal entities that can sue or be sued: V.H. v. British Columbia (Attorney General) , 2005 BCSC 139. [29] In his statement of claim, Mr. Green does not differentiate his claims as between the Province, Canada and the two police departments. None of these claims appears to have merit and I find it is in the interest of justice to dismiss the entire action. [30] The Province and Canada seek a nominal order for costs against the claimant who is a homeless man and who has proven to be indigent. That order was granted March 27, 2018 and is still in force. Although the order does not prevent an order for costs to be made against a litigant in this case, I see note no point in making such an award. [31] After completing these reasons and preparing them for release, a Justice of this Court brought to my attention a requisition filed by Mr. Green on December 27, 2018 in this action, seeking leave to file two affidavits sworn on the same day and an unfiled Notice of Application seeking the following orders in this application: 1. Her Majesty the Queen in Right of British Columbia to be found scandalizing the court. 2. Section 579 of the Criminal Code be found of no force in law. 3. Section 46 of the BC Constitution Act be found of no force in law. 4. The office of the Attorney General to be rebuked. 5. To Strike the Application by Regina for a summary judgement. 6. Joinder and amendment under rule 6 7. Costs at Scale C [32] I have reviewed the material to determine whether it raised evidence of a reasonable excuse for delay in prosecuting this litigation. It does not. It has not been accepted for filing. \u201cB. M. Young, J.\u201d The Honourable Madam Justice Young",

Kovacs    J. Malhi Counsel for the Defendant: K. Armstrong, Q.C. Place and Date of Hearing: New Westminster, B.C. January 5, 2021 Place and Date of Judgment: New Westminster, B.C. January 6, 2021   [1]     Counsel seek a ruling concerning the admissibility of parts of the  expert report of Raph Kowalik. The report is to be tendered by the defendant  in response to the plaintiff's expert report of Dominic Shew. Mr. Shew is an  occupational therapist whose reports provide a functional capacity evaluation  and recommendations for the cost of future case. Mr. Kowalik is similarly  qualified.  [2]     Ms. Kovacs helpfully confines her objections to specified portions of  Mr. Kowalik's report and has identified those portions in a blacklined version  of the report. By way of overview, she rests her objections on three grounds: 1. She  submits that in a responsive report, Mr. Kowalik should confine himself to  criticizing Mr. Shew's opinions based on the assumed facts contained in Mr.  Shew's report and should not be referring to additional factual assumptions  contained in an expert report of Dr. Masri tendered by the defendant that was  not available to Mr. Shew when he prepared his report. 2. She  submits that Mr. Kowalik's report sometimes crosses the line from expert  opinion to advocacy and comingles assumed facts with opinions. 3. She  submits that passages in Mr. Kowalik's report fail to satisfy the fundamental  prerequisite to the admission of expert opinion evidence that it be necessary  to assist the court in drawing inferences. [3]     Mr. Armstrong, Q.C., submits that the authorities make it clear that a  responsive expert report need not simply rebut the first expert's reasoning.   Its proper purview is to address issues raised by the first expert, citing  Luedecke  v. Hillman , 2010 BCSC 1538, at paragraphs 52 and 53. He submits that Mr.  Kowalik's report does not cross the line from opinion into advocacy and that  the passages objected to provide an explanation of Mr. Kowalik's reasoning in  offering opinions in respect of issues raised by Mr. Shew. [4]     I do not agree with Ms. Kovacs that it is improper to base a responding  expert report on new or different factual assumptions than those contained in  the prior expert report. The point of expert evidence is to assist the court  in drawing inferences based on expected primary findings of fact. These  primary findings may be based on evidence tendered by either side. If Dr. Masri's  expert report reveals an assumed fact that places the inferences drawn in Mr.  Shew's report in a different light, there is nothing wrong with pointing that  out in a responsive report.  [5]     Ms. Kovacs acknowledges that Dr. Masri's report was properly served and  she is not objecting to it. In that light, I do not think it is objectionable  per se that Mr. Kowalik has relied upon it. In addressing Ms. Kovacs' specific  objections, I bear in mind the following: (a) As required  by Rule 11-2(2), Mr. Kowalik has certified that he is aware of his duty to  assist the court and not be an advocate for any party and that he has prepared  his report in conformity with his duty. (b) It is  not advocacy for an expert to identify the facts upon which she relies and to  state her reasoning clearly and logically even though the effect may be  persuasive. (c) The  proper concern of expert evidence is the drawing of inferences, not making  findings of primary fact. It falls outside the proper scope of expert opinion  for the expert to offer reasons why the trier of fact should make certain  findings of primary fact. (d) Redacting  an expert report to remove objectionable passages is often appropriate,  Maras  v. Seemore Entertainment Limited , 2014 BCSC 1109. However, it is not  appropriate to redact passages where the redaction would obscure or distort the  expert's reasoning. [6]     Mr. Kowalik disagrees with Mr. Shew's opinion that Ms. Javorovic's work  as a postal service manager requires heavy lifting with reference to a certain  referenced standard. Mr. Kowalik gives three reasons for disagreeing. Ms.  Kovacs objects to the third reason.  [7]     The third reason is that Ms. Javorovic may obtain the assistance of  coworkers. While this is clearly an assumption, it is not identified as such  and Ms. Kovacs is right to say that it should have been. This is the kind of  deficiency that can be addressed, if necessary, through cross-examination and I  would not strike the passage on this ground alone.  [8]     It is not improper for Mr. Kowalik to state the basis for his opinion.   Ms. Kovacs is quite not objecting to the opinion itself. I think it would  distort that opinion to redact a part of the underlying reasoning. It will be  open to Ms. Kovacs to challenge the opinion through cross-examination or in  argument on various grounds. [9]     Mr. Kowalik criticizes conclusions drawn by Mr. Shew in a table  comparing Ms. Javorovic's job requirements with her demonstrated abilities. He  suggests that, properly conducted, the comparison indicates that Ms. Javorovic  is able to meet the demands of her job. Ms. Kovacs objects to the concluding  sentence of the paragraph which states, \"This is consistent with Ms.  Javorovic being capable of working at her job for years following her subject  MVA.\"  [10]     I agree with Ms. Kovacs that the concluding sentence steps over the line  from opinion into advocacy. It is an attempt to persuade me to make a finding  of primary fact. This sentence should be struck. [11]     Mr. Kowalik identifies the question of causation as one bearing on Mr.  Shew's recommendations concerning the cost of future care. He quotes from Dr. Masri's  report and suggests that, based on Dr. Masri's opinion, Mr. Shew's recommendations  overstate the cost of future care attributable to the accident that is the  subject of this action.  [12]     In my opinion, this is appropriate opinion in a responsive report. At  the end of the day, it will be only helpful if and to the extent that I accept  Dr. Masri's opinion and the defendant's argument based on that opinion, but  that is no reason not to admit it in evidence.  [13]     Ms. Kovacs refers to a sentence containing a parenthetical observation  concerning a conclusion drawn in a plaintiff's expert report that will not be  tendered in evidence. This sentence is unhelpful and should be struck. [14]     In the paragraph beginning at line 120, Mr. Kowalik gives reasons for  disagreeing with Mr. Shew's recommendation that Ms. Javorovic receive  vocational counselling and possible retraining. Ms. Kovacs objects to two  sentences drawing an inference based on Dr. Masri's report that Ms. Javorovic  does not need to consider retraining at this time. In my opinion, this is an  appropriate opinion in a responsive report. [15]     Mr. Shew anticipates that Ms. Javorovic will incur costs of future care  in connection with anticipated future surgeries. Mr. Kowalik states that based  on Dr. Masri's opinion, such costs may be incurred. It not inappropriate for  Mr. Kowalik to refer to Dr. Masri's opinion and identify its implications for  Mr. Shew's recommendations. Mr. Kowalik begins the sentence in question with  the words, \"I caution the reader\u2026.\". I do not think that this verbal  formula is any more objectionable than \"I note that\u2026\" or \"The  reader may wish to consider \u2026.\" In substance, Mr. Kowalik has not  descended into inappropriate advocacy.  [16]     To summarize, two sentences should be struck from Mr. Kowalik's report:   the final sentence of paragraph 2 at line 82 to 84 and the sentence at lines  123 to 125. Otherwise, I dismiss the objection. \u201cGomery  J.\u201d",
